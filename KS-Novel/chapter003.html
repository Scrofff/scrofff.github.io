I can&rsquo;t believe what just happened! I was at the bus stop when the Principal pulled over and offered me a lift. It wasn&rsquo;t raining that much and I had an umbrella, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to ride in a fancy car like that so I jumped in. He&rsquo;s SO easy to talk to and was interested in how I was settling in. He said that a lovely girl like me is bound to start making friends soon. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s right.
</p>

<div class="attrib">
<p>
&#x2014;Ikuno Komaki, 2005-05-12
</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>
Your first experience will help you acknowledge and release your anger.
You have been hiding from it, denying that it exists. But it&rsquo;s there and
it will devour you if you don&rsquo;t let it go. Who am I to say this to you?
I am Hanako. My parents were burnt alive and I survived because my
mother shielded me with her body. It was only when I confronted the
shameful anger I harboured for being left alone like <i>this</i> that my
spirit started to heal.”
</p>

<p>
Hanako stands in a pool of light wearing a black, sleeveless dress that
finishes at mid-thigh, her lustrous hair styled in a high ponytail. She
sees the surprise on her former classmates&rsquo; faces and takes pride in how
far she has come since graduating from Yamaku. She had been uncertain
when Rin explained her choice of clothing but when she said, &ldquo;your words
will mean a thousand times more if they can see you,&rdquo; she was convinced.
She found the experience liberating, her friends had displayed respect
and admiration for what she had said and shown them. It felt good to do
something for Hisao and Miki to repay the friendship they had shown her
at Yamaku after Lilly had moved to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
The light fades and she joins them at the table. While she spoke, Lilly
had quietly set a small dish and glass at each place. Seven were
occupied; the eighth, Suzu&rsquo;s, was laid out in exactly the same way as
the others and was presented with the same food. This honoured her and
emphasised her absence. There can be no denying that she is gone.
</p>

<p>
Hisao tries the food and finds it intensely spicy. He reflexively
reaches for the drink and finds it cooling but salty. His anger rises,
an instinctive response to the food and drink, the unsettling background
music, Hanako&rsquo;s words. He is about to speak when he hears Miki speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She should have taken better care of herself. She should have known
that she was sick. She should have given us time to make her better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nods but doesn&rsquo;t reply. Before being seated, Lilly encouraged them to
speak whenever it felt right to do so but asked them not to respond to
what others say. He understands the reason now: there is freedom in
being able to say what you feel without fear of contradiction. Not that
he found anything to disagree with Miki about, she expressed concisely
and accurately the mess of angry feelings he had been struggling with.
Eating, he concentrates on his anger, examines it, understands that it
is irrational.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She said she would finish reading Alice in Wonderland to me. I&rsquo;ve been
waiting for more than ten years to find out what happens next. Now I&rsquo;ll
never know,&rdquo; Rin says sadly.
</p>

<p>
Hanako rises gracefully and clears the empty dishes from the table.
Hisao takes his cue from this and walks to the spot where Hanako had
spoken to them. Lilly had asked him to speak about what he would bargain
for Suzu&rsquo;s life after the first dish. He had given it a lot of thought
and was sure of his bargain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suzu should have lived a long life, should have seen her hard work
turned into the success and recognition her talent deserved, should have
lived out the twilight of her years surrounded by family. My life could
end at any time: an unlucky jostle in a crowded street, a car
backfiring, could trigger a fatal heart attack. I would bargain my life
for Suzu&rsquo;s, though Death would have to be a fool to accept it. I allowed
myself to be selfish and make a life with her and Miki because I knew
they would not be alone if I died early. Exchanging my life for Suzu&rsquo;s
would go some way to undoing the harm my selfishness has caused.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knows that discussing their triangular relationship could be risky
but feels that it dishonoured Suzu&rsquo;s memory not to acknowledge that that
she had been an equal partner in all aspects of their lives. Miki&rsquo;s
approving nod shows him that she agrees with him, much to his relief,
but her frown leaves him in no doubt that she will be having words with
him later about his bargain. Sitting down he finds a medley of steamed
bitter vegetables at his place, dressed in a foamy sauce that also tasts
bitter but with a herbal aftertaste. He quickly understands the message
being delivered: Death cannot be bargained with, trying to do so will
leave a bad taste in your mouth.
</p>

<p>
Natsume feels Naomi start in surprise when she stands and walks to the
focal point of the room; Lilly had been adamant about not revealing that
she would be speaking at the event. &ldquo;Depression has many causes
including progressive illness and bereavement. Whatever the cause,
depression can steal the joy you take in life, can make you neglect the
ones you love, can stop you enjoying your favourite things. It can be
hard to distinguish depression from sadness or despair, in the short
term it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I realise that&rsquo;s a controversial thing to say,
but what I mean is the instant you recognise that you&rsquo;re suffering from
<i>any</i> of the signs of depression, the first thing you must do is <i>talk</i>.
Talk to your loved ones, talk to your doctor, talk to the crazy old man
who shouts at leaves in the park. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who, just talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She walks back to her seat and is met by a kiss from Naomi. &ldquo;If she had
taken her own advice years ago I would have far fewer grey hairs!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume snorts and starts to eat the large rice ball that had been set
at her place while she spoke. The outer layer is stodgy and bland, but
as she makes her way to the centre the layers become lighter and more
flavourful until, at the very centre, she finds a golden egg yolk. Again
the message is clear: if you can work through depression things improve
gradually until you finally emerge into a beautiful sunrise.
</p>

<p>
Once Lilly feels a gentle touch on her leg, she makes her way to where
she knows a pool of light will appear. Rin had chosen a flowing white
dress for her to wear, completing the outfit with white hair ribbons and
white shoes. She explained that Lilly would look like an angel when she
stood in the light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is obvious to me from how people speak, descriptions in books that
are designed to conjure images in the readers&rsquo; mind and the importance
of &lsquo;looking good&rsquo; that vision is our dominant sense. Yet it was only
when I was old enough to read and to spend time with other children that
I became aware that I could not see. I remember being frustrated that I
didn&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;pink&rsquo; was and why the other little girls thought it
was so amazing. Frustration turned to anger as I learned more about this
important sense that I was lacking. I was told to accept that my
blindness was part of God&rsquo;s plan for me. I found that&#x2026;difficult. As
time went by I started to notice that I could hear better than most
people, that I paid more attention to how things taste. My sense of
touch is highly developed, describing the sensual feel of this silk
dress against my skin would have me blushing. I will always regret my
lack of sight, I would love to see what my dear friends look like, but I
have come to accept it. Acceptance came when I stopped dwelling on what
I didn&rsquo;t have and appreciated what I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki blinks back the tears in her eyes as she reaches towards Hisao on
her left, seeing his eyes shining with unshed tears as they
instinctively seek out each other. Reassured by the love she sees in his
expression, she turns her attention to the tall glass in front of her.
Taking a large spoonful of its contents, the taste of perfectly ripened
raspberries explodes in her mouth, followed by the honeyed smoke of the
flavoured cream and the nutty texture of toasted oats. It is such a
joyful combination that she can&rsquo;t help smiling, though there is a little
sadness in her heart as she recognises how much Suzu would have enjoyed
this dessert. Quickly finishing her portion, she is reaching for the
accompanying glass of whisky when she sees Hanako standing up and
raising her glass. &ldquo;Absent friends,&rdquo; she repeats in response to Hanako&rsquo;s
toast and drains her glass.
</p>

<p>
When Lilly announces that the formal part of the evening is over, Miki
stands up. &ldquo;Hanako, Lilly, I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for arranging this.
I also want to thank Natsume, Naomi and Rin for joining us, for giving
Hisao and me the opportunity to remember Suzu with friends. I&rsquo;m so glad
that Hisao clarified that Suzu was not just a friend but an equal
partner in our relationship. In many ways she was the centre, the hub
that we revolved around. We&rsquo;re still trying to come to terms with her
loss and never has the line &lsquo;take comfort in your friends&rsquo; felt more
appropriate.&rdquo; She bows deeply to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know that it&rsquo;s a long time since we were last together, so it might
seem odd for me to refer to you as friends. We must take a lot of the
blame for that, the three of us have been very self-absorbed. But I
would like to reboot our relationship and to find ways to work together
to show the nation that their disregard of us <i>cripples</i> is not only
unjust, but is detrimental to the country. We are not so large that
disregarding any of our talent is a sensible option.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She takes a deep breath and extends a hand to Hisao, pulling him close
when he stands next to her. &ldquo;What I, <i>we</i>, are going to tell you is
rather sensitive. Much more so than the nature of our relationship
because it very firmly treads on the toes of deeply ingrained
prejudices. When Suzu was diagnosed with cancer-&rdquo; her voice breaks and
she clears her throat as Hisao squeezes her hand encouragingly. &ldquo;When
she was diagnosed with cancer and before she started chemo, we decided
to have some of her eggs stored in a clinic in America. We are going to
try to have Suzu&rsquo;s child, with me carrying the baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She lets the surprised murmurs die away before continuing. &ldquo;Obviously we
are not going to advertise the fact that its Suzu&rsquo;s child. Also, to give
the baby the best chance of fitting in, we&rsquo;re going to get married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems very&#x2026;conventional compared to how you&rsquo;ve been used to
living,&rdquo; Lilly notes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but it really is the best way to give Suzu&rsquo;s baby the best chance
in life. We talked about how odd it feels and I&rsquo;m worried about not
respecting her memory. But I think it&rsquo;s what she had in mind when she
insisted that we store her eggs. I think she knew she wasn&rsquo;t going to
make it and she wanted something of her to live on, wanted us to have
something when she left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hears Hisao&rsquo;s ragged breath from containing his emotion and draws
him close for support. &ldquo;As if all that wasn&rsquo;t enough, I&rsquo;m going to
retire from competition and try to transition into a social media
celebrity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi nods, &ldquo;I can see you doing well at that. You&rsquo;ve already got a
following, you&rsquo;re <i>gorgeous</i>, and your refusal to compromise with your
disability gives you immediate credibility with the youth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks Naomi, you&rsquo;re hot too,&rdquo; she replies with a cheeky wink. &ldquo;So I
was thinking, why not take the opportunity to raise <i>all</i> of our
profiles? I&rsquo;m planning on making the wedding a high profile event, so
why not have catering by Hanako and Lilly, coverage by Naomi and Natsume
with photography courtesy of Misaki, visual design by Rin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a profile,&rdquo; Rin says quickly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people knowing
about me, that just leads to questions. Pointless questions, the answers
are there to be seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On social media you share what you want and you control how much you
interact,&rdquo; Hanako says thoughtfully. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be the Bob
Ross of YouTube?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rin fixes her with a steely glare. &ldquo;Mr Ross once said, &lsquo;If I paint
something, I don&rsquo;t want to have to explain what it is.&rsquo; Although we
agree on that, I couldn&rsquo;t change enough to do his memory justice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do court-and-social style reporting,&rdquo; Natsume says.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! I don&rsquo;t want that old school stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I can see an angle that&rsquo;d suit us Nat. Success in the face of
shoddy treatment. A plucky group of school friends reunited by tragedy.
Love triumphing against adversity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever works for you two, with the only proviso that you don&rsquo;t
include anything that might cause trouble for the baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How big an event were you thinking Miki? And Akira will skin me alive
if I didn&rsquo;t ask how it was to be paid for&#x2026;&rdquo; Lilly asks delicately.
</p>

<p>
Seeing Miki&rsquo;s puzzled look, Hanako explains, &ldquo;Akira is Lilly&rsquo;s older
sister and she runs the business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She handles my affairs too because I don&rsquo;t have any. Hands that is,&rdquo;
Rin adds. &ldquo;Or affairs, now I think about it. Hisao, you seem to have
some experience in the matter. Would you recommend that I have some?
Affairs that is, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever have hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rin, I can honestly say that giving your heart to someone who gives you
theirs in return is the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. I don&rsquo;t know about
any other types of affairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well when it comes to hearts, you&rsquo;ve got more reason than most to be
careful. I&rsquo;ll have to add it to my list. I don&rsquo;t suppose you two have a
vacancy now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rolling her eyes Miki says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s quite how it works
Rin. Lilly, we don&rsquo;t want a huge circus, just friends and family. I&rsquo;m
going to work on getting some endorsements but we can cover the cost if
we need to. I don&rsquo;t think something as <i>intense</i> as this has been would
be appropriate for a wedding but I hear amazing things about your more
conventional restaurants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako nods, &ldquo;yes, we can&rsquo;t do many of these types of events a year. It
takes a lot to pull all the different aspects together. Deciding what to
create for each phase gave me more than a few sleepless nights.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well thank you again for going to so much effort for us, despite not
having seen us for many years. If it&rsquo;s not rude, can I ask why you did?
Not that I&rsquo;m complaining at all, it was amazing,&rdquo; Miki adds hastily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When Lilly left, you three did a wonderful thing for me. You treated me
like a regular friend, spent time with me, played chess, talked about
books, went out places. You&rsquo;re teasing scared me at first Miki, but I
soon realised it was just you being you, it&rsquo;s how you treated everyone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you gave as good as you got by the time we graduated!&rdquo; Miki says
with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You gave me the confidence to get involved with the newspaper club and
that&rsquo;s how I stopped trying to avoid this pair of ruffians and came to
love their company,&rdquo; she gestures to Natsume and Naomi. &ldquo;I ended up
believing in myself enough to pursue my real passion in life, cooking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that the creations you put in front of us today can be
called just &lsquo;cooking&rsquo;!&rdquo; Hisao says.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her cooking is like my painting,&rdquo; Rin adds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to ask her
what she means when I eat something she has created, I find the answers
when I see how it is presented, when I taste it. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako blushes, &ldquo;it means a lot to me to hear you say that. Creating is
very personal to me, even after all these years it takes a lot out of me
to put something new in front of someone. I can&rsquo;t speak for Lilly but
I&rsquo;d like to be involved in your wedding, it would be a good way to keep
in contact. I don&rsquo;t want to have to wait another ten years before seeing
you again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank-you Hanako, and sorry again to have been out of touch for so
long. Lilly, the last I knew you were off to re-join your parents. How
come you&rsquo;re back and working with Hanako?&rdquo; Miki asks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I found the situation in Scotland&#x2026;distasteful. As soon as I graduated
from high school I took advantage of the college fund my father had set
up to return to Japan for my degree and naturally I sought out Hanako as
soon as I could. A very changed Hanako I must say, your friendship was a
catalyst for a wonderful transformation. I became a foil for her
creativity; as I mentioned I have very acute senses and my parents have
taken me to many of the world&rsquo;s best restaurants over the years. I was
able to give her feedback on what did and didn&rsquo;t work in her cooking.
Then when we graduated from university and were looking around for what
to do next, Akira decided that she&rsquo;d had enough of working in Scotland
too and we decided to try and make a go of a restaurant. We pooled all
our money and opened a small place, slept in the attic, and slowly it
snowballed to the business we have now. It turns out that I have an
aptitude for managing our staff, allowing Akira to focus on extending
the business and Hanako on her cooking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a great surprise, Ms Class Rep!&rdquo; Naomi laughs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never designed for someone who is hard <i>and</i> squishy. If you don&rsquo;t
make me work with other people and you accept how I see you, I&rsquo;ll do
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Seeing Miki&rsquo;s uncertain expression, Hanako reassures her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
known her to be wrong. When she said I should wear <i>this</i> tonight I
wasn&rsquo;t sure to start with. Actually I was terrified, but she was right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah she was right.&rdquo; Miki grins suddenly, &ldquo;and who knew you&rsquo;ve been
hiding <i>that</i> body all these years!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rin nods, &ldquo;one day she&rsquo;s going to agree to sit for me. I won&rsquo;t let her
have her clothes back for <i>weeks</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rin! That&rsquo;s really not convincing me to let you paint me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give in one day, it would be a crime not to. And it would be a
crime to let anyone else design for you Miki.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK, thank you Rin, I look forward to seeing what you come up with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume sees Naomi giving her a significant look. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to
glare at me Naomi, I was going to propose a deal.&rdquo; At their puzzled
looks, she continues. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you noticed that Ikuno&rsquo;s death was
reported in the same issue of the newsletter as Suzu&rsquo;s. She got in touch
with us just days before she died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nat, Lilly and Rin don&rsquo;t know why that might be important. We didn&rsquo;t
talk to anyone else at school about what happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nodding, Natsume continues, &ldquo;yes, some context is important. Hisao and
Miki noticed that Ikuno was behaving oddly, specifically she was was
seen with several men, and talked to us. Their description of her
behaviour made us think of the article we had written about the
compensated dating scene involving Japanese schoolgirls and sure enough,
once we set Hanako on the trail, she found Ikuno&rsquo;s profile on a dating
site. Naomi and Miki spoke to her about our concerns, offering her
someone to talk to, and I understand it turned heated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki nods, &ldquo;yeah I lost my temper at some of the bullshit she was coming
out with and she blew up at us. Threatened to talk to the Principal if
we ever went near her again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, and as I&rsquo;m sure you remember, I said that we should let things
lie since Ikuno was so against accepting anything we offered in the way
of help. That was only half true. What I didn&rsquo;t say to anyone but Naomi
was that I strongly suspected that the Principal was involved somehow
and considered that it was safer for us to drop the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lilly gasps, &ldquo;Yamaku&rsquo;s Principal involved in schoolgirl prostitution?
How did you come to that conclusion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does sound improbable, but this was my thinking at the time. The
Principal stopped us publishing an article on compensated dating, he
said that such things were unfitting for Yamaku. After learning about
Ikuno I believed that he didn&rsquo;t want the topic raised, didn&rsquo;t want
people looking for signs of it amongst the student body. Ikuno was given
a lot of latitude by the school authorities, she was never disciplined
for ignoring curfew. If she really did have family responsibilities that
kept her late, why didn&rsquo;t she stay overnight with them and return early
the next day? The final, most damming, thing was what Miki said about
Ikuno threatening to involve the Principal. Given that we&rsquo;d found her
profile, why was she so confident that he&rsquo;d take her side and not just
expel her for bringing Yamaku into disrepute?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can follow your thinking Natsume, but it&rsquo;s only a theory, a rather
far-fetched one at that,&rdquo; Lilly says dismissively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t feel confident about pursuing it. We
were in a vulnerable position, he could have expelled us for any made up
reason. But since graduating I&rsquo;ve often thought about this, I&rsquo;ve felt
guilty that I haven&rsquo;t done anything to find out if this man has been
exploiting vulnerable kids in his care. That feeling has got worse since
he started to exploit his position as Yamaku&rsquo;s Principal to get involved
in politics. It&rsquo;s been incredibly frustrating, we have suspicions that I
think are well founded but no way to move forward with them. Until Ikuno
contacted us,&rdquo; she continues, an intense look in her mismatched eyes.
&ldquo; &lsquo;What I could tell you would cause a century of scandals.&rsquo; &rdquo; She grips
Naomi&rsquo;s hand tightly, feeling a reassuring warmth in response. &ldquo;I hope
she didn&rsquo;t lose her life for telling us that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really Natsume, don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s rather over dramatic?&rdquo; Lilly
asks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She died from an insulin overdose. The police are treating it as an
accident or suicide. Hisao, you were at Yamaku for less than a year,
what do you think about the accidental overdose theory?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shakes his head, &ldquo;Nurse was very hot on making sure we knew our meds,
our doses, inside out and back to front. I haven&rsquo;t lost the habits he
drilled into me so I can&rsquo;t imagine someone who was there for three years
making a mistake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That leaves suicide as the most probable cause. Why are you even
thinking about foul play? It seems to me that you&rsquo;re making huge leaps
from very little evidence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lilly-&rdquo; Hanako begins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should listen to the professionals, they are the ones in possession
of the facts, the ones with the experience to make sense of-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lilly!&rdquo; Hanako repeats, loud enough to cut her off. &ldquo;Tell them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a sigh Lilly begins, &ldquo;we inherited this restaurant when Hanako&rsquo;s
mentor, Mr Hanaya, retired. He said she was the only student he had
trained worthy of its legacy. Along with the incredible honour comes a
number of headaches, the biggest being the client list.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We host functions for some <i>very</i> publicity-shy individuals,&rdquo; Hanako
adds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On occasion we have requests for me to run front of house. I assume
they believe that because I can&rsquo;t see them, I can&rsquo;t identify them. Which
is ludicrous, it&rsquo;s second nature for me to recognise people by their
voice. Hence I know that some very highly ranked politicians have been
here, sometimes in rather unsavoury company. One time I heard a voice I
recognised from school but I was not able to recall the name. I told
Hanako and she peeked when they were leaving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was Ikuno,&rdquo; Hanako confirmed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was that the only voice you recognised that evening?&rdquo; Naomi asks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the time it was. Later I recognised two of them from radio news
programmes. One was a politician making a statement about resigning from
the government but denying sexual harassment. The other was a defendant
at that big Yakuza trial a couple of years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that confirms Ikuno was moving in rarefied circles. Why were you
so resistant to the idea of foul play?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Seeing Lilly hesitate, Hanako replies, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s very protective, always
wanting to mother people, keep them from harm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, thank-you Hanako! There is a grain of truth in that.&rdquo; Hearing
Hanako&rsquo;s snort she admits, &ldquo;alright, more than a grain. Feel free to
laugh at me but after recognising the company she was keeping that
evening, I felt a responsibility to warn her. Of course I had no contact
details for her so there was nothing I could do. But it has been at the
back of my mind and hearing you talk about her made me feel guilty. I
suppose I do not want to face up to having failed her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No-one is going to laugh at you Lilly, you&rsquo;re not the only one who
feels that way. Natsume always says that we&rsquo;re not responsible for the
actions of bad people. She&rsquo;s right of course, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop me
from feeling guilty at times. How were they treating her? Could you tell
anything from how they were speaking to her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank-you Naomi. I was not in the room with them very much but the
little I heard made it seem that they were treating her as an honoured
guest. I am remembering a predatory tone in the politician&rsquo;s voice but I
can not be sure that it truly was there or if I am embellishing my
memories based on knowledge I acquired subsequently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I saw her she had become much more interesting than she was at
school. I wanted to collect her as she was leaving Department H but I
was on a bombing run with Wanto and didn&rsquo;t want to break the flow. The
outfit she was wearing looked better on her than on the cow that donated
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What language are you speaking Rin?&rdquo; Miki asks with a puzzled look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming you mean Ikuno was wearing leather?&rdquo; Naomi asks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dried blood leather. Not that much of it, skin tight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dried blood?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hex 4C0A0A. Rusty red brown. Dried blood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was she with anyone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Big man in a bad suit, sunglasses at 2am, not much left of the little
finger on his left hand. Some people don&rsquo;t appreciate what they&rsquo;ve got,
I&rsquo;d never treat a finger like that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yakuza again. How would you describe her bearing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confusing, a lion pretending to be a lamb.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you two going to explain what you&rsquo;re talking about or should the
rest of us go home and leave you to it?&rdquo; Miki asks, exasperated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hang on, I&rsquo;ll try to clarify but I&rsquo;d like to know when you saw her
Rin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the height of blossom season, but I can&rsquo;t say which one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. OK what I understand is that
Rin was out in central Tokyo at 2am in spring. What were you doing Rin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was doing art.&rdquo; Naomi shrugs. &ldquo;She saw Ikuno but didn&rsquo;t talk to her
because it would have disrupted the&#x2026;art. Ikuno was accompanied by what
looked like a Yakuza heavy and had just left Tokyo&rsquo;s longest established
fetish club. Despite being dressed in a revealing leather outfit she was
poised and confident, comfortable with the rôle she was playing. There
was a touch of contempt in her for those she considered tourists to the
scene, who visit a club once or twice a year and live the rest of their
lives in suburban mediocrity, though it was well concealed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just repeated what I said. What was the point of all those
words?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I actually understand now,&rdquo; Miki says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a talent
you&rsquo;ve got Naomi, turning those few words into a scene that I can
picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a vivid picture of what Rin saw but I&rsquo;m not sure what it
<i>means</i>,&rdquo; Hisao agrees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then stop imagining Ikuno in skintight leather and start thinking!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit harsh Nat, we haven&rsquo;t told them what your contact in the
coroner&rsquo;s office told you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s totally imagining her in that outfit,&rdquo; Miki laughs, running her
hand through his hair and leaning in for a kiss.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dignifying that with a response! What <i>did</i> you learn from your
contact?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two things. She had marks on her body consistent with traditional tight
binding practices. That&rsquo;s not particularly surprising, it&rsquo;s almost part
of the national psyche by now and the aesthetic aspects of kinbaku have
crossed into the mainstream. I imagine that most couples have dabbled at
some point.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My my, speaking of bondage as commonplace. Am I the only one feeling
inadequate? My relationship with a nice salaryman seems rather&#x2026;staid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Its not a competition Lilly, whatever makes you happy. We found the
second one more disturbing. Apparently she had extensive scarring on her
body, they thought that a scalpel was used but sharp blades are another
part of our national psyche.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shiny cobwebs on her skin,&rdquo; Rin agrees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blood red leather,&rdquo; Hanako says thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We seem to be coming to the conclusion that Ikuno made a living from
offering specialised sexual services. If she was then it is very likely
that she would have been involved with the Yakuza, and from what Lilly
and Rin told us it seems that she was. We could also infer from what
Lilly said that she was being used as a negotiating piece with
politicians, or maybe as a honey trap. We could interpret what Rin saw
as meaning that she was, well I don&rsquo;t want to say <i>happy</i> with her life,
perhaps that she accepted her nature and took pride in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good Hisao, thinking with your brain instead of your other organs!
You&rsquo;ve already given us your thoughts on accidental overdose as cause of
death, what about suicide?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rolling his eyes at Natsume&rsquo;s jibe, he rubs his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I
can get into her mindset well enough to answer that. Let&rsquo;s assume that
she was a pawn of the Yakuza. Given the level of access she seemed to
have provided them I doubt she would have had any material needs. She
would have been too valuable to mistreat, but at the same time too
valuable to be left unsupervised. I don&rsquo;t know if she would have tired
of life as a bird in a gilded cage eventually. Oh, she contacted you
didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Seeing Natsume nod, he continues, &ldquo;that makes me think that
she wanted to make changes, maybe wanted to take control rather than
having her life run for her. I&rsquo;m a mathematician not a psychiatrist, but
that doesn&rsquo;t seem to me to fit the profile of someone thinking of ending
their life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to hear someone else&rsquo;s reasoning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Particularly when it agrees with yours, right Nat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think we can all agree that there are a lot of unanswered questions
concering Ikuno&rsquo;s life and that her death, however it happened, is very
sad. But I&rsquo;m not sure how she relates to the deal you mentioned
Natsume.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitates before answering, &ldquo;nor am I now, Hisao. I was going to
propose that we share any information we had about Ikuno and ask you all
to talk to anyone you thought might be able to throw some light on the
matter. In return I would have agreed to cover your wedding in our own
way. while respecting your concerns about the baby. I was hopeful that
between us we would have some parts of the Ikuno puzzle but I was not
expecting to learn quite as much as I have. I wanted,&rdquo; she shakes her
head, &ldquo;I <i>want</i> to find out if Yamaku&rsquo;s Principal is pimping out the
children he is supposed to be responsible for and I saw Ikuno as a way
to get a handle on that. But it looks like she moved deeper into the sex
industry unlike the majority of girls who literally grow out of it when
they leave school. The clientele tends to like their girls young. Very
young,&rdquo; she says with a grimace. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always tried to steer clear of
stories that are overtly tied to the Yakuza. It&rsquo;s impossible to avoid
them completely in the type of work we do, but for our longterm health
we try not to attract the attention of the bigger cartels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time not to be so careful Nat, attitudes are changing.
They&rsquo;re not the force they used to be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, but they&rsquo;re still deeply entwined with the highest
authorities and it&rsquo;ll be more than a few more generations before that
ends. But you&rsquo;re right, their wings are being clipped. I am nervous
about Ikuno&rsquo;s situation though, what Lilly told us indicates that she
was moving in the very highest circles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if the Principal still had his claws in her? You said he was
breaking into politics, what if he was using her as an entrée into the
upper echelons?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things I&rsquo;m worried about, we could be getting into a
real nest of vipers. But it&rsquo;s been nagging at me for years, what if my
failure to act, my <i>cowardice</i>, has allowed him to continue poisoning
the lives of vulnerable girls?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been a coward Natsume, you faced down anyone and everyone
at school. I&rsquo;ve read your articles, your work hits hard and takes no
prisoners. Of course you have to take care of your personal security. I
know all about that, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the wackos I attract. But
that&rsquo;s not cowardice, that&rsquo;s just making sure you&rsquo;ll be around to keep
fighting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank-you Miki, it&rsquo;s reassuring to hear that from someone like you. I
doubt myself at times.&rdquo; She sighs, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know where to go with
this. We were going to meet Ikuno and listen to her story, from school
to the present. If what she told us implicated the Principal we&rsquo;d have
been on to him like a flash. If not, we would have done a profile and
exposé, and my mind would be at rest. Now we can&rsquo;t do either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The police are going to take the path of least resistance and find that
Ikuno died from an accidental overdose. They always want to close cases
like this as soon as possible and she doesn&rsquo;t have an influential
relative or partner to kick up a fuss and get a proper investigation.
I&rsquo;m not OK with that. What we&rsquo;ve figured out this evening leaves me with
very little doubt that she was killed. And yes Nat, I know I shouldn&rsquo;t,
but I feel guilty. If she hadn&rsquo;t reached out to us maybe she would still
be alive.&rdquo; She hold her hands up to cut Natsume&rsquo;s response off. &ldquo;Yes
yes, too many unknowns to know for sure, but it&rsquo;s how I <i>feel</i> and
there&rsquo;s nothing you or anyone else can say to change that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think she wanted to change again,&rdquo; Rin says, a statement rather
than a question. &ldquo;She had changed a lot when I saw her, become much more
Ikuno than she was at school. It was a good change but you think there
was more to come and now she can&rsquo;t, she is stuck between what she was
and what she wanted to be and she needs some help to let her be what she
wants to be. I want to help her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rin, you understand that she&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; Hanako asks tentatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean she doesn&rsquo;t need help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sort of help are you thinking of?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about helping, but doesn&rsquo;t it help people to
understand them? To learn their story?&rdquo; The yearning in her usually
expresionless voice catches everyone&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;I know a lot of
street artists. No-one pays attention to us, but we see and we remember.
There might be enough of her story in our memories for me to understand
her well enough to paint the Ikuno she wanted to become. She was an
artist, her realm was the senses, we should remember her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it helped Suzu but remembering her, telling some of our
story tonight has helped me.&rdquo; Seeing Hisao nod in agreement, Miki adds,
&ldquo;helped us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you do learn more of her story, will you tell us Rin?&rdquo; Naomi asks.
</p>

<p>
Grimacing, she replies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather show you but I can try to tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there someone who understands <i>you</i> Rin? Someone who knows your
story?&rdquo; Lilly asks gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe. No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I would be honoured to hear your story, to try and understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rin&rsquo;s answer is slow to come. &ldquo;It would be difficult. You use words, I
use images. We find it hard to communicate anything meaningful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is something we would have to work out, but surely it is better to
try than not try?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe. Yes. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll learn to be better with words,
that wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad change.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Standing up, Miki says, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t retired yet and I&rsquo;m due on the track
tomorrow so I think I&rsquo;ll call it a day. I have to say that I&rsquo;m feeling
quite overwhelmed. Finding old friends, feeling accepted, remembering
Suzu. Your support for my crazy idea for launching us into the
spotlight. And Ikuno. I never got to know her really, I sat next to her
for years but we just never clicked, we were too different. Despite that
I want some resolution for her. Maybe its the Yamaku effect, the old
school spirit, whatever. I&rsquo;m not sure what I can do, but I know all
sorts of people so I&rsquo;ll see what I can shake out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is getting late and isn&rsquo;t it our turn to go to the markets
early tomorrow Hanako? Give me a moment and I will call the cars round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Before we set off, can I confirm that we all know how to contact each
other?&rdquo; Natsume asks. They quickly establish that Rin is the only one
whose details have yet to be shared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t contact people. People don&rsquo;t contact me. Except Hanako and she
calls when I&rsquo;m busy. How do you know just the right time to call so that
you interrupt me at the worst possible moment? Or do I mean just the
wrong time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing, she replies, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re <i>always</i> busy. It doesn&rsquo;t matter when I
call you, the first thing you say is that I&rsquo;m interrupting something
important.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sounds right, there&rsquo;s no point doing unimportant things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking that we should get together regularly, keep in touch,
share stories.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kids use group chat on their smartphones for stuff like that these
days,&rdquo; Hisao suggests.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who even knows how to do that?&rdquo; Naomi asks rhetorically. &ldquo;Besides I&rsquo;d
like to spend time with you guys, have some nice food, a few drinks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Finding times when we are all available might be difficult, but I agree
that meeting in person is preferable. Ah, it sounds like the cars have
arrived, I&rsquo;ll bid you good night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a chorus of goodbyes and promises to meet soon, the group disperses
into the Tokyo night.

<p>
Hisao closes the door behind them with a sigh of relief, slips off the
uncomfortable formal shoes and loosens his tie. &ldquo;That was one hell of an
evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki nods, &ldquo;yeah. It was really good to see them after so many years.
I&rsquo;d say Lilly and Rin haven&rsquo;t changed much, just grown into themselves
if you see what I mean. Naomi&rsquo;s added a layer of sophistication to the
pixie thing she had going on, but Natsume&rsquo;s looking a bit ragged around
