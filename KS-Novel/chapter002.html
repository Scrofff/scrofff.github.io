My homeroom is class 1-3, Ms Kirino is nice enough but some of the other girls are scary. I sit next to Miura who is terrifying, so cold and angry. The sleepy girl and the legless girl seem OK, hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to make friends with them. There&rsquo;s a couple of cute boys, I sit next to one and the red-head in the back row is really hot!

&#x2014;Ikuno&rsquo;s diary, 2005-04-04
</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>
Natsume starts the laborious process of working through her inbox. The
usual assortment of trash emails, threats and angry denunciations are
deleted without a second thought. She flags a couple of messages from
agencies to look at later and spots the latest Yamaku alumni newsletter.
Settling back with a sigh she grabs her coffee mug and starts to browse
through it. After a while she stiffens and calls out, &ldquo;Naomi!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nooo,&rdquo; comes the sleepy reply from the bedroom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you know that Suzu died?&rdquo; She hears Naomi swear as she stubs her
toe in her haste to join her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, in our class at Yamaku. You must have read at least one of her
book reviews.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s just a surprise. She&rsquo;s so young, <i>was</i> so young. How
did you find out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reading the Yamaku newsletter, there&rsquo;s an obituary and a quote from
Hisao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just when her career was taking off, it feels so unfair. I never
would&rsquo;ve thought that she&rsquo;d be the first of our classmates to go. I
wonder why Hisao was quoted? I would have expected something from Miki.
I guess they&rsquo;re still together then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suzu&rsquo;s reviews were very insightful, rigorous but accessible. I&rsquo;m going
to miss seeing how she would have developed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miki&rsquo;s obviously got a high profile, but I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about
Hisao since school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume snorts, &ldquo;obviously you&rsquo;re not keeping up with medical physics
research, he&rsquo;s been developing mathematical tools for modelling
electrical processes in the human body. His publications get a lot of
citations so I think it&rsquo;s significant work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi kisses Natsume on the neck as she leans over to read the article.
&ldquo;Cancer! I thought it would have been something related to her
narcolepsy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at what he&rsquo;s written, it seems they missed warning signs because
she was used to being tired all the time. Oh Hisao, so brave, so like
you to try to get people to look after themselves. Don&rsquo;t know about you,
I&rsquo;m scheduling a check-up as soon as I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do we have contact details for him? I&rsquo;d like to send my condolences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume gives her a sideways look, &ldquo;and, knowing you, find out why <i>he</i>
was quoted instead of Miki.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi pouts, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re curious too! But I do want to give him my best
wishes, he was always kind and thoughtful to us, the nicest of the boys
in our class by far.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get up one of his publications, it&rsquo;ll have an email address for
him.&rdquo; As she is about to switch to a browser, she spots a small notice
under Suzu&rsquo;s obituary. &ldquo;Oh shit, Ikuno&rsquo;s dead too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she can&rsquo;t be! I was in contact with her just three days ago!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a last minute addition, it says there will be a proper obituary in
the next edition. I don&rsquo;t know whether to be impressed or scared by how
well informed they are&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi hugs Natsume tightly. &ldquo;Do you think it has anything to do with
what she was talking to us about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume shakes her head. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t speculate until we know how she
died.&rdquo; She draws back and looks sternly at Naomi. &ldquo;You know we did
nothing. We can&rsquo;t take the blame if it was foul play, it&rsquo;s never our
fault if bad people do bad things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi sighs, &ldquo;yes of course, but I find it really difficult when people
get hurt when we-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the alternative though? Letting these maggots continue to eat
society from the inside is far worse, causes much more harm in the long
run.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>know</i>, I&rsquo;m still working with you right? If I thought we did more
harm than good I&rsquo;d take one of the offers I get from the celebrity mags.
But you can&rsquo;t tell me that you don&rsquo;t feel bad at times?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never! Does a surgeon feel bad for cutting a tumour out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I had your certainty. You&rsquo;ve always been the strong one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume shakes her head, &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;m rigid, brittle. You sway in the wind,
yield but never break. It&rsquo;s a different type of strength, don&rsquo;t ever
think you&rsquo;re weak. We complement each other so well, it&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re such
a good team. It&rsquo;s why I love you so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi kisses her gently, &ldquo;always with the right words. I love you too.
Reading that,&rdquo; she points to the screen, &ldquo;is making me think about how
I&rsquo;d cope if I lost you. I can&rsquo;t bear the thought-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor can I, I don&rsquo;t want to think about it. I&rsquo;m going to get a proper
check up as soon as I can. Will you do the same, for me?&rdquo; When Naomi
nods, she sighs and says, &ldquo;thank-you. I&rsquo;ll get contact details for Hisao
and we&rsquo;ll send him a message. Then once we&rsquo;ve taken care of the living
we&rsquo;ll try and find out what happened to Ikuno.&rdquo;

<p>
Hanako sips her tea as she reads the Yamaku Alumni newsletter. She
frowns when she comes to Suzu&rsquo;s obituary and grabs her phone. &ldquo;Lilly,
Hanako here. Are you sitting down? No, it&rsquo;s not a problem with our
business. Do you remember Suzu, one of my classmates at Yamaku. Yes, the
sleepy one.&rdquo; She rolls her eyes. &ldquo;She passed away recently, there&rsquo;s an
obituary in the latest Yamaku Alumni newsletter. I got it by email, your
braille edition probably won&rsquo;t arrive for a few days. How do I feel? A
bit shaken, I didn&rsquo;t know her that well but it&rsquo;s always a shock when
someone you know passes on. I wouldn&rsquo;t have called except that there&rsquo;s a
quote from Hisao in the obituary, he must have been close to her.&rdquo; She
listens for a while. &ldquo;Probably, though it&rsquo;s not nice to call Miki &lsquo;the
stumpy one&rsquo;. I have fond memories of Hisao too. He must be feeling
awful, can you think of anything we could do for him? Host a memorial
service? I like that idea. No I don&rsquo;t have contact details for him, but
leave it with me, I&rsquo;ll let you know when I&rsquo;ve tracked him down. Yes,
I&rsquo;ll liaise with Akira.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
Hisao sits in his office at home, waiting for his PC to boot up,
thankful yet again for the flexibility his research position affords
him. As long as he continues to secure research grants he has no other
schedule than his own. His Dean is very happy with both the amount of
money he has brought in and the prestige his publications have brought
to the faculty. As is his habit, he opens his email and scans through to
see if anything needs his immediate attention. Two messages catch his
attention and he reads them quickly. &ldquo;Miki, come and have a look at
this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She comes in munching a croissant, wearing training kit. Despite having
seen her countless times over the last decade, Hisao can&rsquo;t help but
admire her lean, curvy body. &ldquo;Stop drooling, it&rsquo;s not a good look,&rdquo; she
says, kissing him to show that she&rsquo;s teasing. &ldquo;You better not have lured
me in here for something sordid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not immediately&#x2026; We&rsquo;ve got a couple of emails about Suzu, one from
Naomi and Natsume, the other from Hanako.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki smiles, &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d stayed in contact with Natsume, she&rsquo;s one hell
of a woman. Most people thought Shizune was the alpha bitch but I saw
her back down many a time when Natsume got started on her.&rdquo; She quickly
reads their message. &ldquo;Well that was lovely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you good friends with them? They seem keen to know how you&rsquo;re
getting on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was more mutual respect thing than close friendship. I think they&rsquo;re
fishing, trying to find out why you were interviewed for the newsletter
rather than me. Last they knew, Suzu and me were besties. What&rsquo;s Hanako
got to say?&rdquo; Hisao opens her email and sits back to let Miki read. &ldquo;A
memorial service in their Tokyo restaurant? Wow, that&rsquo;s a generous
offer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suzu was atheist through and through, I&rsquo;d be uncomfortable with
anything religious, it&rsquo;d feel disrespectful to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Services are for the living, but I take your point. Maybe tell her we&rsquo;d
prefer to have a meal with some of our classmates and remember Suzu,
catch up with each other.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nods, &ldquo;yeah that would be better. I like how us Yamaku graduates look
out for each other when the shit hits the fan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not only in the bad times, you know I was planning on getting in touch
with them about the wedding, the publicity will be good for them too.
Since I&rsquo;m here, can I read the obituary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yeah, I haven&rsquo;t read it either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki sits on Hisao&rsquo;s lap and they hold each other tight as they read.
&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; she whispers. &ldquo;Did they quote you accurately?&rdquo; When he nods
she kisses his cheek, feeling his tears against her lips. &ldquo;That was well
said, if just one person gets themselves checked out you&rsquo;ve done a fine
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to have done a fine thing,&rdquo; he sobs, &ldquo;I just want her
back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pulls him tight, &ldquo;I do too but it&rsquo;s not an option, so you do what
you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I keep expecting to see her when I walk into a room. I find myself
starting to tell her something and then I realise she&rsquo;s not there.
She&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> be there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know. When grandpa died, grandma said one of the hardest things was
not being able to talk about him. I understand her now, at least <i>we</i>
can talk about Suzu, keep her memory alive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nods, starting to calming down. &ldquo;The grief comes and goes, the worst
part is feeling guilty when something makes me happy. I know it&rsquo;s
stupid, she wouldn&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The worst thing for me is feeling guilty for wanting you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, that too. She wouldn&rsquo;t resent us finding joy in each other, she&rsquo;d
be cheering us on. I know it in my head but, my heart disagrees.&rdquo; He
pauses to wipe his eyes. &ldquo;What did you think of her grave?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was beautiful. I know I&rsquo;ve not exactly had anything good
to say about her parents and I&rsquo;ll always resent the way they pushed us
out when Suzu died, but they must be going through the same hell that we
are. Maybe one day they&rsquo;ll be able to talk to me, I&rsquo;d love to tell them
about the wonderful woman Suzu grew into, the woman they never really
knew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once again I&rsquo;m humbled by your generous heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh hush, you know that competing has taught me not to dwell on the
negative. Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but I&rsquo;m sure I felt her presence at the
grave. There was such a surge of joy when I thought about having her
child, the marriage, I&rsquo;m convinced she&rsquo;s smiling down on us and giving
us her blessing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hugs her tight. &ldquo;As a man of science I&rsquo;m supposed to say that&rsquo;s
superstitious nonsense, but I felt something too. I want to believe that
she&rsquo;s cheering us on and it&rsquo;s not just wish-fulfilment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki stands and pulls Hisao onto his feet and into her arms. &ldquo;Come on,
let&rsquo;s try and find some of the joy you were talking about while she&rsquo;s
smiling on us. Maybe we&rsquo;ll be in the proper frame of mind to send
replies after.&rdquo;

<p>
Hanako divides her latest recipe between Lilly and Akira&rsquo;s plates
and sits down to watch how they respond. Lilly&rsquo;s face always gives her
the most honest reaction, unfiltered by tact or diplomacy. Her rapturous
look makes Hanako smile in relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you change? This is heavenly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know that I&rsquo;d have to kill you if I told you,&rdquo; she giggles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And that would be bad for business,&rdquo; Akira replies, finishing their
running joke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want this to leave them uplifted, reinforcing the good memories and
giving thanks for her life rather than dwelling on its loss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lilly says thoughtfully, &ldquo;we should pair it with a botrytis
sémillon wines and change the background music to something uplifting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Subtly change the colour temperature of the lights to something
warmer,&rdquo; Akira adds. &ldquo;You two are going to a lot of effort for a girl
you have seen for years&#x2026; OK, OK, I know, I wasn&rsquo;t at Yamaku so I don&rsquo;t
understand the ties you have. But I <i>do</i> understand business and this is
costing a lot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t everything sister dear, but if you&rsquo;re desperately worried I
think we&rsquo;ll be able to offer something similar as one of our experience
packages. An aging population means there&rsquo;s a lot of money in funerals
and memorials.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides its a way for me to do something for Hisao and Miki. You know
what a big role Hisao played in bringing me out of my shell and Miki was
challenging in a good way, a way I needed at the time. I&rsquo;m excited to
see them again, it&rsquo;s just a shame that it&rsquo;s taken a tragedy to bring us
together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Akira shrugs, &ldquo;hey, I&rsquo;m just the one with a bit of business savvy that
keeps you two creatives from going off the rails. Tell me where you want
to go and I&rsquo;ll do my best to get you there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako smiles fondly at her as she shakes her head, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re far more
than that, we&rsquo;d still be dreaming our lives away in regular jobs if you
hadn&rsquo;t taken a chance on us, given up your secure career against the
wishes of your parents and turned our wild ideas into a <i>very</i>
profitable business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a partnership,&rdquo; Lilly agrees, &ldquo;a synergy where we each contribute
what we do best and hold each other to the highest standards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Akira laughs, &ldquo;you two saved me from a dead end, I was bumping up
against the glass ceiling and chafing at the bit for more
responsibility, the opportunity to spread my wings. I&rsquo;m just glad it&rsquo;s
worked out, I never told you how scary it was to have you two expecting
me to make your crazy ideas work, I was flying by the seat of my pants,
making it up as I was going along. But I&rsquo;ve never felt more <i>alive</i>, I
wasn&rsquo;t born to toe the corporate line any more than you two were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lilly reaches out towards her sister, who takes her hand with a smile.
&ldquo;I suppose we should get in touch with Rin, run the visuals by her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Noting the reluctance in her voice, Hanako replies, &ldquo;yes! I know you
find her hard to deal with but no-one else comes <i>close</i> to tying all
the elements together. She might not be a core part of the team but we&rsquo;d
be less effective without her. I&rsquo;ll see if she&rsquo;s free now.&rdquo;

<p>
Rin looks in annoyance at the &rsquo;phone as she is about to leave her
apartment, dressed in black with a messenger bag slung over her
shoulder. Only the the caller-id showing Hanako&rsquo;s number stops her from
walking out of the door. With a sigh she slips a sandal off and presses
the <i>answer</i> button. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s me, who else were you expecting? I
have no idea what I&rsquo;ll be doing tomorrow morning, ask me tomorrow
afternoon and I&rsquo;ll tell you. What about my calendar? Oh, alright.&rdquo; She
checks the date and walks over to the large calendar on her wall.
&ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m doing nothing tomorrow morning.&rdquo; Satisfied with her
answer, she presses the <i>end</i> button.
</p>

<p>
Retrieving her sandal, she turns to leave when the phone rings again.
&ldquo;Hanako, I&rsquo;m about to be busy and I answered your question. Oh. Well my
calendar says I <i>could</i> come along tomorrow, but I don&rsquo;t always do what
it tells me. Not that it speaks. What? A new experience menu? Hisao?
Suzu? Alright, but not too early. Half eleven is fine.&rdquo; After ending the
call she stares at the &rsquo;phone for a moment, daring it to ring again.
When it stays silent she slips out into the Tokyo night, on her way to
meet up with Wanto and the other members of 246.

<p>
&ldquo;Oh my Nat, look at this.&rdquo; Naomi holds up a very formal invitation
card. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only ever heard <i>rumours</i> about this place, no-one I know
has actually been there. To think that Hanako and Lilly run it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a rigmarole! Strict dress code, no phones, no cameras or other
recording devices, we will be picked up and taken to the venue. It&rsquo;s
just a restaurant for goodness sake!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi looks sternly at Natsume. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;just a restaurant&rsquo;! Never
mind the fact that you have to be <i>invited</i> to eat there, the food is
supposed to be only one element of a complete sensory package and it&rsquo;s
said that they never repeat themselves. It&rsquo;s extraordinarily generous of
them to do this in memory of Suzu.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I remember right, it&rsquo;s supposed to seat eight. I wonder who else
will be there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Shrugging, Naomi replies, &ldquo;Apart from Hisao and Miki? I wonder if Hanako
and Lilly will participate or officiate. Suzu wasn&rsquo;t that outgoing, I
can&rsquo;t think of many other people she was close to at school. Anyway,
we&rsquo;ll find out in a week. In the meanwhile, back to business. We&rsquo;ve got
four potential commisions with two that will need Misaki&rsquo;s input, one
that will require us to travel to America, and one that&rsquo;ll need a very
deep dive into the national library. I hate long journeys and the
thought of being locked up in the stacks is not exactly enticing at this
time of year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Agreed. Tell me about the other two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The first wants us to get inside one of the crews responsible for the
graffiti epidemic in Tokyo.&rdquo; Seeing Natsume grimace she says, &ldquo;yeah, not
really our thing. I have no contacts even remotely associated with that
scene. It&rsquo;s a shame for Misaki though, this type of photography is right
up her street, she&rsquo;d carry the article with her images.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pass the details on to her, she can get a head start on the photo work
for whoever they get to write the article. What&rsquo;s the last one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A look behind the scenes of the luxury holiday industry, exposing the
conditions of the casual labour it depends on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perfect. Not only do we get to expose scumbags, but we do it in the lap
of luxury! Pack that string bikini you&rsquo;ve got hidden in your drawer,
we&rsquo;ll need some eye candy for Misaki to shoot,&rdquo; Natsume says with a
wicked grin.
</p>

<p>
Blushing, Naomi says, &ldquo;no way are you going to put my backside in
another article!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a <i>splendid</i> backside, it&rsquo;ll double our readership and
no-one will ever know it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i> know it&rsquo;s me! If you&rsquo;re so keen on the idea, how about we use
yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got all the looks in this relationship, no-one wants to see my
bony arse and knobbly knees.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Catching a hint of bitterness in her voice, Naomi walks over and kisses
her deeply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my favourite arse in the world. Anyway, our work
doesn&rsquo;t need prettying up to make an impact, I say we leave the visuals
to Misaki. I <i>will</i> take the bikini though, strictly for our down
times,&rdquo; she says with a cheeky wink.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me tell you what I&rsquo;ve found out about Ikuno. The word is she died
due to complications arising from an insulin overdose. She was found
unconscious in Aoyama Cemetery by someone who was visiting a grave and
died without regaining consciousness two days later. My contact is
saying that they&rsquo;re treating it either as an accident or a suicide.
There were no marks on her body to indicate any sort of struggle and
there were no other fingerprints on the empty insulin pen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi frowns, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember if she had to inject when she was at
school. I&rsquo;m certain I never saw her, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, I
never really spent any time with her. Nurse will never let his guard
down enough to violate patient confidentiality, but our woman on the
inside might be able sneak a look at the records.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish all our contacts would work for parfaits! From what I&rsquo;ve read
most diabetics end up having to inject insulin, so it won&rsquo;t mean
anything if she didn&rsquo;t need to at school. I haven&rsquo;t had any luck so far
in finding out who her doctor was, let alone whether she was being
prescribed injected insulin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We know where she lived right? I can do some legwork in the area, talk
to pharmacists, see if I can find where she got her meds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ve got a recent photo you can have. I&rsquo;m not buying accidental
overdose. Anyone who went to Yamaku, who survived Nurse, knows better
than that, is <i>trained</i> better than that. Her credit history is
immaculate so we can probably rule out financial pressure as a driver
for suicide. That leaves depression and social isolation as the most
likely causes if she did take her own life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I can find her pharmacist I&rsquo;ll ask whether she was on
anti-depressants and see if they can tell me anything about her frame of
mind. Social isolation though&#x2026; When Miki and I spoke to her about the
dating thing she said she was lonely, but at the same time she pushed us
away. I think I only saw her twice more after she changed class. Which
makes it all the more surprising that she contacted us recently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;What I could tell you would cause a century of scandals.&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t
decide if she was mixed up in something very shady and was killed to
keep her quiet, or she was mentally ill and ended her own life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi nods, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been contacted by so many crackpots, it&rsquo;s hard to
believe <i>anyone</i> when they say they&rsquo;ve got a massive story for us. One
day&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One day&#x2026;&rdquo; Natsume echoes. &ldquo;Maybe this is it. We just have to keep
doing what we do best: collecting tiny pieces of the puzzle and fitting
them together until we see the big picture.&rdquo; A quiet tone from her
computer alerts Natsume to a new email which she opens eagerly when she
sees who sent it. &ldquo;Apparently she has faint abrasions on her torso,
upper arms and upper legs, consistent with natural fibre ligatures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Interesting but not necessarily evidence to support her statement. You
know how much I enjoy your brand of tight binding&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about this. &lsquo;Her torso is a tracery of fine scars, the cuts
inflicted by an extremely sharp cutting instrument such as a scalpel.&rsquo; &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Again, interesting but not conclusive. But it does give us a new avenue
to investigate.&rdquo; She adopts a meek expression, but the twinkle in her
eyes betrays her excitement. &ldquo;This one would be honoured for Mistress to
show her off in the clubs.&rdquo;
