So here I am, Yamaku Academy at last! Time for a new start, I&rsquo;m not going to be the timid girl I was at middle school, this time I&rsquo;ll have friends and we&rsquo;ll have so much fun!
</p>

<div class="attrib">
<p>
&#x2014;Ikuno Komaki, 2005-03-12
</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>
The phone rings and Hisao picks up.<br />
&ldquo;Good morning, my name is Haruko Chikada and I&rsquo;m calling on behalf of
the Yamaku Alumni Association. Can I speak to Mr Nakai?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speaking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am calling because we have recently been informed that one of our
former students, Ms Suzu Suzuki, has sadly passed away. We will be
writing an obituary for her in the next Alumni Newsletter and, as you
are listed as one of her contacts, and I wonder if there was anything
you wanted to add to the article?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao almost puts the phone down as waves of grief threaten to overcome
him. Suzu&rsquo;s death last week closed the happiest decade of his life to
date and he still has no idea whether what remains of the family will
stay together; he has barely seen Miki since they sat on either side of
Suzu&rsquo;s bed, holding her hands as she took her last breaths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr Nakai? I am so sorry to intrude on your grief and if this is a bad
time I could call back, or I would completely understand if you are not
able to say anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no I&#x2026; <i>she</i> deserves some words and I hope I can send a message to
your readers. Suzu succumbed to cancer last week which was not diagnosed
until too late. One of the early warning signs, excessive tiredness, was
masked because she was narcoleptic and being tired was something she
struggled with every day of her life. Please, don&rsquo;t accept changes in
your conditions as &lsquo;normal&rsquo;. If any of your symptoms intensify seek
medical attention. Suzu was angry at herself for ignoring what, in
hindsight, were warning signs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What Hisao can never say is that he is also angry. He blames himself and
he blames Miki for not noticing the changes in Suzu. There is deeply
buried, shameful, but persistent anger at Suzu for letting herself die.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give you the usual list of adjectives to describe her,
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard them many times before. The only other thing I
want to say is that Suzu was a wonderful friend and an inspiration to
all of us who knew her well. She established herself as a feelance
critic, reviewing books for newspapers and magazines. She loved this
work and she said that her time in the Literature Club at Yamaku gave
her the inspiration for following this career. It was also an occupation
that her narcolepsy did not affect too much since she could work at home
and at her own pace. This is another lesson she taught me, and I hope
the readers learn from it too: don&rsquo;t dwell on what your disability
<i>stops</i> you doing, search out what you <i>can</i> do and make a success of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank-you Mr Nakai, I know that this must have been very difficult for
you. You have said powerful and important words and I will do my best to
do them justice in Ms Suzuki&rsquo;s obituary.&rdquo; After a short pause <b>charname</b>
continues, &ldquo;we also have Ms Miura listed as a contact but I haven&rsquo;t been
able to talk to her yet. Can you help me contact her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao shrugs, &ldquo;sorry but I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;ll have any more luck that
you do in getting in touch with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well thank-you for your help. Are you on the mailing list for the
newsletter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I get it via email. I do enjoy reading the success stories you
highlight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a kind thing for you to say given the circumstances. We aim to
publish Ms Suzuki&rsquo;s obituary in the next issue, due at the end of this
month. I&rsquo;ll stop intruding on your grief now, thanks again for your
message.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao puts the phone away with a little regret: talking about Suzu was
painful but cathartic and he has not had much opportunity to speak to
anyone about her since Miki disappeared.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
Hisao is halfway through his third glass of whisky when
the front door bangs and his heart leaps. &ldquo;Miki?&rdquo; he calls
apprehensively. She walks in, exhausted, dishevelled, shamed-faced.
Hisao is on his feet and by her side so fast he hardly remembers moving.
He wraps her in his arms, nose wrinkling at the smell of stale beer and
cigarette smoke on her clothes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Hisao, I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve let you down I couldn&rsquo;t cope I don&rsquo;t
know how to cope I don&rsquo;t know how to <i>be</i> without her and you must be
the same but I wasn&rsquo;t there for you I don&rsquo;t know how to&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shh,&rdquo; he interrupts her, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re here now. You&rsquo;re not going away again
are you?&rdquo; When she shakes her head he sighs in relief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that
matters, I was so scared that I&rsquo;d lost you both. I would not be able to
bear that&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hisao&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s get you cleaned up and I bet you haven&rsquo;t eaten for days. If
you want to say anything after that then that&rsquo;s fine, otherwise it&rsquo;ll
keep till tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leads her to the bathroom and undresses her, takes off his own
clothes and sits her on the bathing stool. He carefully washes her,
noting the bruises and scrapes. He has to wash her hair twice before it
is properly clean. Her stump is very red, but he follows his own advice
and says nothing. She passively accepts his care and lets him put her in
the hot bath. When he turns to the door she protests, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t leave me
Hisao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stoops and kisses her on the forehead, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to throw a
pizza in the oven and be right back, you need to eat. So do I for that
matter, pizza should soak up the whisky.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he comes back to the bathroom he joins her in the bath, sitting
behind her so she can lean back into his chest. They sit there without
speaking, just being close to each other, until the oven timer alerts
Hisao that the pizza is ready. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clean bathrobe on the back of
the door, throw that on and come and eat something.&rdquo; sk1p Hisao brings
the segmented pizza into the lounge and puts it on the low table in the
centre of the room, seeing Miki sitting on the couch opposite the telly.
Without talking they start eating, reluctance fading as they realise how
hungry they are. Before long it is all gone and Miki moves to Hisao and
straddles his lap&#x2013;her habitual position whenever she could. Hisao
embraces her with a sob. &ldquo;I was so scared we&rsquo;d never share this again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki hugs him tighter, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Hisao, I&rsquo;m back now and I&rsquo;ll nev-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that unless you <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s true. Suzu never planned to go
away either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nods, the tears starting to run down her face. &ldquo;Hisao, I have to
tell you wha-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m interrupting you all the time. You don&rsquo;t have to tell me
anything specific OK? Just tell me that you&rsquo;ve been safe. Tell me you
haven&rsquo;t done anything that&rsquo;ll have anyone looking for you.&rdquo; He feels her
tensing up in his arms. &ldquo;Miki?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some fucker tried to hit on me in a bar, all I wanted was to drink&#x2013;all
I&rsquo;ve <i>done</i> is drink&#x2013;and he wouldn&rsquo;t take no for an answer. I hit him
and the owner kicked him out. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be any come-back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t recognised?&rdquo; When she shakes her head he sighs in relief.
&ldquo;OK, don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re a <i>face</i> these days, we were lucky.&rdquo; Hisao
changes the subject. &ldquo;I spoke to someone from the Yamaku Alumni
newsletter earlier today, they&rsquo;re writing an obituary for Suzu. It was
the first time I&rsquo;ve spoken about her and it helped, a little bit. Do you
feel up to talking about her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reasons I came home. I ran from my feelings but they
were always there. I thought that being with you would be unbearable,
looking at you would make me miss her, but you&rsquo;re the only one who
understands. I love you so much, I love Suzu so much, I don&rsquo;t want to
forget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel the same. There&rsquo;s a huge hole in our lives but let&rsquo;s face it
together. What are we going to do to commemerate her? I still don&rsquo;t
understand why her family had to push us out, it hurt like hell not to
be able to go to wake or the funeral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve hated us for years, taking their <i>baby</i> away from them,
encouraging her to be independent instead of being a proper woman and
having a husband and children. I wonder what they would do if they knew
how we <i>actually</i> lived?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao snorts, &ldquo;yeah, she certainly wasn&rsquo;t the misled innocent they seem
to think she was. Remember how she would give that innocent look with
her sleepy eyes before doing something absolutely <i>filthy</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When did you believe we could work as a trio? I knew I couldn&rsquo;t lose
either of you after running myself into the ground that day. Suzu seemed
pretty comfortable with it from the start and thinking back, I&rsquo;m pretty
sure the cheeky cow manipulated us both into this. Not that I&rsquo;ve ever
had any complaints! But you&#x2026;you seemed uncomfortable at the beginning,
as if you were going along with it so you didn&rsquo;t lose me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was exactly it to start with. I mean it&rsquo;s not as if I didn&rsquo;t like
Suzu, but <i>you</i> were the one for me, I&rsquo;d never felt for anyone what I
felt for you. What I feel for you. But that week we spent by the sea in
the summer holidays when I got to know her better, when we weren&rsquo;t
distracted by school stuff and other people. That&rsquo;s when I knew that I
could love her too. I really liked her sense of humour, how smart she
was. And she looked pretty good in that bikini! It was being able to
relax with each other, to learn how we could be together in and out of
bed, that made me realise how good the three of us were. Like she said,
any two would be a great pair but the three together was something else!
Which was just as well, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been satisfied with just one
of us, I could tell that you <i>adored</i> being the focus of both of us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki giggles, &ldquo;hell yeah, it was great while <i>that</i> lasted. But it was
even better when things evened out and it stopped being Miki and Suzu,
and Miki and Hisao. When it was just the three of us. Ten amazing years.
What blows my mind is how few arguments we had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was there to argue <i>about</i>? We weren&rsquo;t shy about being
affectionate when we were alone, we were all getting great sex. Most of
all we were all happy with the roles we had. Suzu the dreamer, pointing
us the way. Hisao the planner, figuring out how to get us there. Miki
the doer, making it happen. Sure we all did a bit of each but roughly
that&rsquo;s how it went from my point of view.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a simple man, Hisao! Cuddles, plenty of sex, and good food is
all you need to be happy. Oh and that maths stuff you do, I know you get
jumpy if you don&rsquo;t do that a few times a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ha, you&rsquo;re not much more complicated yourself! Substitute running for
maths and the same applies to you.&rdquo; He pauses, &ldquo;how do you think we&rsquo;ll
get on without her? Are you going to be satisfied with just me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shakes her head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m missing her terribly but that doesn&rsquo;t mean
that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with what we&rsquo;ve got. I thought that you&rsquo;d
worked through that uncertainty years ago?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much that I&rsquo;m uncertain, though of course I am feeling lost
without Suzu. You&rsquo;ve been used to having a man <i>and</i> a woman in your bed
so I was concerned that there was something you got from her that I
couldn&rsquo;t provide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wraps him up in tight hug. &ldquo;Yes, there were things Suzu did for me
that you don&rsquo;t and vice versa. But they&rsquo;re <i>Suzu</i> things, not &lsquo;woman&rsquo;
things. There a lot we are going to have to adjust to without her but I
think our love life is the least of our worries. Anyway I don&rsquo;t want to
think about that now, I want to talk about Suzu with the only other
person who really knew her. Get another glass and we&rsquo;ll sink that bottle
to her memory.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
They talk about Suzu for the rest of the night, sharing memories,
laughing at the good ones, crying at the sad ones. They know that they
will continue to miss her for the rest of their lives, but the despair
they had been feeling is starting to give way to grief as, together,
they begin to come to terms with their loss.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about the baby Hisao? We would have something of Suzu.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He scratches his head. &ldquo;The eggs my friend harvested before Suzu started
chemo are still in the clinic in America, I don&rsquo;t think there would be
any <i>technical</i> issue in fertilising and implanting one. We&rsquo;d need to
think about whether we <i>should</i> do it and when&#x2013;I don&rsquo;t want us to make
a hasty decision that we regret later. If we decide to go ahead, we need
to have a clear plan on how we would provide for the littl&rsquo;un.&rdquo;

What Hisao does not say is that Miki has been earning the most for the
last couple of years. Hisao&rsquo;s research post pays well, but Miki&rsquo;s high
profile as one of Japan&rsquo;s top sprinters has attracted generous
endorsements. Her clothing brand has branched out from sportswear and
she has been developing a cosmetics range.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I want to carry Suzu&rsquo;s baby. She&rsquo;s left us, but we can have
her baby. What would we be waiting <i>for</i>? I think Suzu urged us to take
the eggs because she knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t make it and she wanted to
leave something behind for us. It doesn&rsquo;t stop <i>us</i> having a baby, I
don&rsquo;t want to have just one child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what about your competitive career?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki takes his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always love running, but I don&rsquo;t enjoy
competing any more. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, racing is in my blood but I&rsquo;m
tired of all the crap that goes with it. I don&rsquo;t want to be away so
much, I don&rsquo;t want to have to piss into a cup after a race, I don&rsquo;t want
to be gawked at, to have bastards in the crowd shouting that I should be
in the <i>cripple</i> event. One girl I beat said that I have an unfair
advantage &lsquo;cos I have less weight to carry. Fuck that, I&rsquo;m really
enjoying creating the new clothes, the cosmetics, modelling. I&rsquo;m going
to try my hand at YouTube, my people have been talking to Jeffree Star&rsquo;s
people which is crazy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Seeing the confused look on his face, she laughs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a
beauty guru! Vlogging pregnancies is huge too, and then there&rsquo;s life
coaching and motivational vidoes&#x2026; I&rsquo;ve spent a <i>lot</i> of time on those
endless &lsquo;plane trips working out content. I think our income will go up
and I&rsquo;ll be here more.&rdquo; Her face falls. &ldquo;I wish I had been here more,
I&rsquo;ll regret not spending more time with Suzu for the rest of my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, you can&rsquo;t think like that! We&rsquo;ve all been busy establishing our
careers, I&rsquo;ve had to travel too. There&rsquo;s no way we could have known that
we&rsquo;d lose her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So what do you think about having the baby?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, even if your new career doesn&rsquo;t work out we&rsquo;d be OK financially,
I earn enough to keep us going and I could take some of the consultancy
work I&rsquo;ve been offered. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m going to be a good dad but I
really want to find out. We mustn&rsquo;t expect Suzu&rsquo;s baby to be a quick
fix, it won&rsquo;t stop us missing her, but at least we&rsquo;ll have a part of her
with us. If you&rsquo;re <i>sure</i> about the change in direction-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never been more sure. When do we do it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hugs her tightly. &ldquo;Always got to do everything <i>now</i>! We&rsquo;ve got to
make time for a trip to America. I&rsquo;ll get on to my friend about setting
up an appointment at the clinic. We should get married too, don&rsquo;t want
little Suzu to suffer the stigma of being illegitimate. And we should
probably not advertise that you&rsquo;re carrying a dead woman&rsquo;s child, we&rsquo;d
never live that down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marriage vlogs are <i>huge</i>, it&rsquo;ll be a good way to kick off the
channel.&rdquo; Seeing his surprised look she says, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mind
commercialising the marriage do you? It&rsquo;s just a meaningless formality
as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, my level of commitment has never depended on a
stupid piece of paper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, I feel the same way. But it gives us legal and social benefits,
and benefits your new career. It feels really shitty that we&rsquo;re doing
this without Suzu and I can&rsquo;t begin to say how much it sucks that losing
her makes things easier. But it&rsquo;ll make her child&rsquo;s life easier and I
<i>know</i> she&rsquo;d be OK with that. My only reservation is whether we&rsquo;re
moving too fast. Will people think we&rsquo;re forgetting her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shakes her head. &ldquo;No-one really <i>knew</i> how we lived. Maybe there
were people who thought it odd that we were still all lived together,
but I never heard about it. My mum and your parents haven&rsquo;t given us
grief, though I bet they&rsquo;re curious. I think they&rsquo;ll be happy about the
wedding. As for how fast we&rsquo;re moving? Well it&rsquo;ll take a quite a long
time to get the marriage sorted. Well, not so much the marriage but the
venue, the publicity, endorsements&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK, but don&rsquo;t get so busy that we don&rsquo;t sit down and remember Suzu
regularly. Let&rsquo;s do this for her, and her baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Agreed. I think we should mobilise our fellow Yamaku alumni. Hanako and
Lilly&rsquo;s restaurants are starting to gaining legendary status, they&rsquo;d be
ideal for catering the event. Natsume and Naomi seem to be all over the
papers these days, along with Misaki&rsquo;s photos, we can see if they&rsquo;d do a
write up for us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao frowns, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a hell of a departure from their usual exposé
pieces&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki nods, &ldquo;yeah, but I doubt they&rsquo;d do a straight puff piece. I&rsquo;d be
interested in seeing how they&rsquo;d tackle it. And Misaki&rsquo;s got a fantastic
eye, she&rsquo;s done some stunning pictures of me racing. She&rsquo;d do the formal
set pieces well but also get a lot of candid stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao checks his watch. &ldquo;Breakfast time. Don&rsquo;t know about you, but I&rsquo;m
not feeling sleepy and I&rsquo;m actually hungry for the first time in days.
How about I cook us something up and we go and visit Suzu&rsquo;s grave? Her
parents can&rsquo;t stop us doing that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that. We can tell her about the baby and ask her blessing for
the marriage. I want her to be the first to know.&rdquo;
