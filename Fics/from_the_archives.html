<p>
I thought I&rsquo;d find you here Nat,” Naomi says as she walks into the
newspaper club&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;What are you up to, apart from avoiding me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just tidying up, making sure I&rsquo;ve got copies of everything before I
leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re wandering down memory lane,&rdquo; she replies, gesturing
at the files and pictures scattered on the coffee table. She sits
opposite Natsume and picks up a photograph of Miki and Hisao in running
kit with Suzu, asleep, supported between them. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> a story waiting
to be told!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looks like a normal day at Yamaku to me. Poor Suzu, I don&rsquo;t know how
she&rsquo;s going to make her way in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When Miki and Hisao got together she was <i>very</i> put out. Whenever she
saw them together she&rsquo;d look daggers at them. Of course <i>they</i> didn&rsquo;t
notice, I&rsquo;ve never seen a couple so wrapped up in each other. I couldn&rsquo;t
tell if Suzu was angry with one of them in particular or if it was being
ignored that was annoying her, she was used to having most of Miki&rsquo;s
attention.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you notice these things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have my head in the clouds making grand plans, unlike you! Then
one Monday morning the three of them came into class together, all
smiles. The daggers were gone, Hisao and Miki stopped being quite so
antisocial, and Suzu blossomed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I remember being surprised when she suddenly started
participating in class. What do your keen journalistic instincts tell
you happened?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi flashes a cheeky grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say they have a ménage a trois
going on but I&rsquo;m pretty sure Hisao&rsquo;s too conventional for anything like
that. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like him and he&rsquo;s always <i>so</i> kind and
friendly, but I could never work out what a firecracker like Miki sees
in him. I suppose he must be <i>very</i> well endowed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naomi, you&rsquo;re awful!&rdquo; She passes a clipping over the table. &ldquo;Hana&rsquo;s
first proper article. I&rsquo;m really glad she came out of her shell and
joined us, she&rsquo;s brought so much to the club. Lilly leaving might turn
out to be the best thing that happened to her since she came to Yamaku.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was really proud of tracking down the book thief on her own! No-one
<i>ever</i> suspected that she was our ace in the hole. They&rsquo;re so used to
ignoring her, she&rsquo;s able to blend into the background. The best
undercover reporter the club&rsquo;s ever had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume sighs as she pulls out their article on Japanese schoolgirls and
compensated dating. &ldquo;Our best work, unpublished. The only regret I&rsquo;ll
have when I leave here is that we never got to the bottom of what was
going on with Ikuno and the Principal. Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have been so
cautious about investigating them but I was worried about crossing such
an influential man. I should spend less time worrying about risks and
more time thinking about rewards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;ll regret that too, but I can think of something I might regret
more,&rdquo; Naomi says, giving her a pointed look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This was probably the worst idea you ever had!&rdquo; Natsume flicks a
disdainful finger at the trial issue of an advice column.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, there was <i>nothing</i> wrong with the concept. Highschoolers have
lots of problems, we&rsquo;d have got an endless supply of easy content. It
was <i>you</i> who decided that Misha should be our agony aunt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I sure as hell wasn&rsquo;t going to do it and I don&rsquo;t remember you
rushing to volunteer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not, I can&rsquo;t even sort out my own relationship.&rdquo; She sits
forwards and takes one of Natsume&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Nat, I&rsquo;m going to try this
one last time. No deflections, no evasions, give me straight answers. We
graduate tomorrow but every time I&rsquo;ve asked you what you&rsquo;re planning to
do next, you change the subject. As it stands we&rsquo;re heading in different
directions. Is this <i>really</i> how you want us to end? After being so
close for so long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume is silent for an uncomfortably long time. &ldquo;A clean break is
best. We&rsquo;re moving into adulthood so it&rsquo;s natural to leave things
behind, even things you treasure. I&rsquo;ll never forget you Naomi, the best
times I&rsquo;ve ever had have been with you, working together in this room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That makes no sense, who is it best <i>for</i>? It&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s best for
<i>me</i>! I see no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t move on together. You&rsquo;re the best
friend I&rsquo;ve ever had, I <i>know</i> you don&rsquo;t have anyone you&rsquo;re closer to
than me. And what about the night we spent together? It <i>really</i> hurt to
wake up and find that you&rsquo;d sneaked off and to make things worse you
pretended that nothing had happened. What was that about? I could tell
you were into it just as much as I was. I&rsquo;m more than willing to be your
girlfriend and society can go screw itself for all I care. Or is <i>that</i>
the problem? You want to fit in and having me around would make it
difficult for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! You know that I&rsquo;m not one to care much about what others think of
me. Besides this is Japan, observing the proprieties in public is what
counts not what happens in private.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So what <i>is</i> the problem? Why do you keep pulling away from me?&rdquo; Naomi
raises her voice in hurt and frustration. &ldquo;You know how I feel about
you, and I know how you feel about me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume locks eyes with Naomi, regret and longing written all over her
face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you throw your life away on a cripple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi stands up angrily. &ldquo;Well Ms Ooe, I think that&rsquo;s all that needs to
be said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naomi?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is gracious of Ms Ooe to call this one by her given name. This one
is not sure what she has done to deserve such an honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naomi, stop it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only if you stop treating me like a child and let me make my own
decisions! Yeah, your arthritis might cripple you but it&rsquo;s a risk I
<i>want</i> to take because it means I get to be with you.&rdquo; She slumps onto
the couch next to Natsume, the anger draining out of her. &ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t
have feelings for me I could accept that we&rsquo;d just be friends, I&rsquo;d be
<i>happy</i> with that. But it&rsquo;s crazy to me that you won&rsquo;t let us be
together in a misguided attempt to protect me. &lsquo;Specially as <i>you&rsquo;re</i>
the one who&rsquo;d be taking the bigger chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could die during a fit or injure myself badly enough to be a
vegetable the rest of my life. Any number of things could happen but I&rsquo;m
prepared to treat you like an adult and let <i>you</i> decide if I&rsquo;m worth
taking a risk on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re worth it, I&rsquo;m the one wh-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then shut up and kiss me you stupid girl!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I-it&rsquo;s about time you two s-stopped dancing around each other and g-got
together properly!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They look around in surprise and see Hanako smiling at them as she walks
to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dammit Hana, how many times have I told you not to sneak up on me?!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;W-what did you think the best undercover r-reporter the club&rsquo;s ever had
would be doing when something as important as t-this is happening?&rdquo; she
smirks as she leaves the clubroom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I liked her better when she was shy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean Nat! We haven&rsquo;t got time to be distracted, we&rsquo;ve got to
figure out where we&rsquo;re going to study after graduation, <i>what</i> we&rsquo;re
going to study! I read that Waseda University has a <i>fantastic</i>
investigative reporting cour-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Deciding that it was about time she did what she had been told, Natsume
wraps her arms around Naomi and starts kissing her. When she feels Naomi
relax she pauses and whispers, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll worry about that tomorrow, I&rsquo;ve
got other plans for tonight&#x2026;&rdquo;
