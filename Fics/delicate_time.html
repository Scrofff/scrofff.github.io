<h1 class="title">A delicate balance</h1>
<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the
balances are correct.&rsquo; ” Suzu&rsquo;s copy of Dune is nearly as dog-eared as
mine, must be one of her favourites too. &rdquo;See? We absolutely <i>do</i> need
to take some time to make sure we&rsquo;re properly in balance. I feel like
there&rsquo;s been too many distractions here, we&rsquo;ve had no opportunity to
figure out how to <i>be</i> together.&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look if you want a holiday just say so, you don&rsquo;t have to come out with
some fancy quote. I&rsquo;m definitely up for a week of sun, sea and sex!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t help rolling my eyes at Miki. &ldquo;What do you mean by balance
Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to run yourself half to death then have a tearful
reconciliation in the heat of the moment, it&rsquo;s another to actually make
this work. Miki said we have a lot to talk about, which is true, but we
haven&rsquo;t done <i>anything</i>. Be honest, what has changed since then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be fair we&rsquo;ve been snowed under with exams, projects, training for
the meet. You two are, umm, intimate again so that&rsquo;s changed.&rdquo; Maybe
saying I&rsquo;d rather share Miki than lose her wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to do
but I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything else, the thought of breaking up
almost gave me a panic attack. I&rsquo;ve never had feelings this strong
before, it&rsquo;s kinda scary. Sometimes I worry that I&rsquo;m obsessed by her. I
don&rsquo;t think I am, I&rsquo;m not showing any of the unhealthy signs, but I
can&rsquo;t deny she captures most of my attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well yeah, and I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; my best to make sure you don&rsquo;t feel left out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Is that a guilty look on Miki&rsquo;s face? I wanted to make her happy, not
stress her out. &ldquo;No no, I don&rsquo;t feel&#x2026;/abandoned/, I&rsquo;ve hardly noticed
a difference with all the studying we&rsquo;ve been doing. Suzu&rsquo;s probably
right, we should take some time away and work this out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m always up for a holiday. Can you con your parents into
letting us use their beach house Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No con required, they suggested I take some friends down. They&rsquo;re in
Europe for six weeks, they&rsquo;ve finally got tickets for Bayreuth, so as
usual they&rsquo;re throwing stuff at me so they don&rsquo;t feel guilty for never
seeing me. They said we could borrow one of the cars too, have you got a
licence Hisao?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wow, she&rsquo;s very matter-of-fact about her relationship with her parents.
&ldquo;No, I was keen to learn but my hospital stay delayed everything&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh well, I suppose the train&rsquo;s reasonably convenient. When shall we
go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about Monday? Gives me time to do a bit of shopping over the
weekend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shopping?! What are you planning on buying?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m as surprised as
Suzu but I&rsquo;m not brave enough to say anything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just some&#x2026;stuff. And things, can&rsquo;t forget the things. I need a new
bikini too, I&rsquo;ve grown out of my old one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ooh I can&rsquo;t wait to see her in a bikini!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m off to bed. Thanks for dinner Suzu, it&rsquo;s your turn to cook
next Hisao! I&rsquo;ll catch you two tomorrow, thank fuck it&rsquo;s only a half day
until the break.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I find myself staring mournfully after Miki as she walks out of Suzu&rsquo;s
room. &ldquo;I guess I should be going as well. See you in the morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bye Hisao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She&rsquo;s looking a bit miserable too. At least we&rsquo;ve got a holiday to look
forward to now, hopefully we&rsquo;ll cheer up once we&rsquo;re away from the
pressures here and get a chance to talk things through.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
We&rsquo;re up early to catch the first train down to the beach house but even
though we&rsquo;re off on an adventure, there&rsquo;s not much enthusiasm on
display. Suzu&rsquo;s obviously struggling with the sleepies and Miki&rsquo;s
looking strained, the tension in her jaw tells me her phantom pains are
bad. They&rsquo;re both so brave, there&rsquo;s not a word of complaint as we make
our way from the bus stop to the platform. Miki&rsquo;s on one side of Suzu
and I&rsquo;m on the other, making sure she&rsquo;s walking in the right direction
and not bumping into anything. I guide us to a bench and put our luggage
in Miki&rsquo;s sight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to grab something from the Kiosk, do you two
want anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Coffee!&rdquo; they chorus. Yeah, me too. I&rsquo;m not feeling as bad as they are
but my insomnia didn&rsquo;t let me get much sleep. We must have all suffered
alone in our rooms, it would&rsquo;ve been better to get together for support
like we used to.
</p>

<p>
I buy the coffees, add tooth-rotting amounts of sugar to the girls&rsquo;, and
walk back to where they&rsquo;re slumped against each other. &ldquo;Coffee&rsquo;s up! The
train will be here soon and we&rsquo;ll be able to relax for a while.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
good to see them trying to smile, let&rsquo;s hope this rough start won&rsquo;t cast
a shadow over the whole holiday. No, I can&rsquo;t see that happening, Miki is
never down for long and her mood is infectious. Besides, seaside! Who
can be gloomy when they&rsquo;re near the sea?
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
The change at Morioka gave us a chance to buy fresh coffees as we walked
to the platform where we caught the train to Miyako. This leg of the
journey will take a couple of hours so we&rsquo;ve got time to make ourselves
comfortable. I&rsquo;m glad Miki and Suzu are looking happier than they did
earlier this morning. I&rsquo;m sitting opposite them, a table between us
which we&rsquo;ve stacked some snacks and drinks on. I attempt to read the
article on applications of group theory which Mutou recommended but it&rsquo;s
hard to stay focused. Last night&rsquo;s lack of sleep and the beautiful
countryside we&rsquo;re travelling through are distracting, though not as
distracting as the sight of Miki and Suzu cuddled together. Shouldn&rsquo;t I
be feeling jealous? Resenting Suzu for coming between us? <i>Something</i> is
troubling me but I can&rsquo;t figure out what. Come on Hisao, analyse!
</p>

<p>
OK the most important thing is I believe Miki won&rsquo;t ditch me now that
she can be with Suzu too. I don&rsquo;t feel threatened by Suzu because what I
know of their history tells me she accepts she can&rsquo;t monopolise Miki,
she&rsquo;s not going to try to break us up. Same for me, I understand that I
don&rsquo;t have the right to tell Miki what to do. Suzu&rsquo;s always been
friendly and welcoming, being around her is great fun thanks to her wry
sense of humour and our shared love of reading. Truth be told, I&rsquo;ve
become really fond of her. I didn&rsquo;t like seeing her miserable on Friday
so it&rsquo;s good to see a happy little smile on her face as she leans in to
Miki. Am I feeling left out right now? Yes, I&rsquo;d love to be in that
cuddle, my troubles melt away when we&rsquo;re touching. But that&rsquo;s not enough
to explain what&rsquo;s bothering me.
</p>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t stop worrying about the guilty expression on Miki&rsquo;s face the
other night. Was it a mistake to make her split herself between Suzu and
me? There&rsquo;s something <i>right</i> about the way they look together, Miki
holding her protectively, Suzu&rsquo;s head on her shoulder. They&rsquo;ve been
through so much, have such a strong bond, maybe it&rsquo;s me who&rsquo;s come
between <i>them</i>. Maybe I should step out of their lives, get off at the
next station and go back to Yamaku. Oh, she&rsquo;s not asleep. And just like
that, all my uncertainties are swept away as she flashes her dazzling
smile and reaches out to me. I clasp her hand and smile back. There&rsquo;s no
guilt on her face now, only a satisfied smile as she squeezes my hand
and snuggles into Suzu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand guard Hisao, don&rsquo;t let us miss our stop. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I squeeze back and she sighs happily as she closes her eyes. They have
given me nothing but understanding and affection and in return I was
thinking about abandoning them. What sort of scumbag would do that? No,
I won&rsquo;t run away but we do have to puzzle out how we&rsquo;re going to work
together, make sure we&rsquo;re OK with the situation. The look on her face
tells me she wants this, there must be a way for us all to be happy.
Damned if I know what it is though&#x2026;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
The taxi ride to Suzu&rsquo;s beach house didn&rsquo;t take long and I was surprised
by how reassured I felt when we passed a hospital. Standing on the drive
where we&rsquo;d been dropped off, I&rsquo;m impressed by the size of the house and
its secluded location.
</p>

<p>
Suzu points to a wrought iron gate in the hedge. &ldquo;That path goes to the
beach, it&rsquo;s not private but we only really share it with visitors to the
local country club and they&rsquo;re usually busy playing golf.&rdquo; She picks up
her bag and walks to the door. &ldquo;Plausible deniability requires us to
pick a bedroom each.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki laughs at my puzzled look. &ldquo;The Suzuki family retainers come in
every few days to clean and re-stock, we have to maintain appearances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Kobayashis aren&rsquo;t <i>retainers</i>, just a sweet old couple who look
after this place. We don&rsquo;t want to be giving them a heart atta- oh sorry
Hisao, that was probably rude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I shrug, &ldquo;not at all, having had a heart attack I don&rsquo;t want to be the
cause of one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki grabs her rucksack and trots past Suzu as she opens the door.
&ldquo;Noooo!&rdquo; Suzu shrieks as Miki puts on a burst of speed. &ldquo;She <i>always</i>
gets the master bedroom, it&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You Snuzu, you lose-u!&rdquo; I look up to see Miki on the balcony smiling
smugly; how on earth did she get there so fast?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking the Green Room then! Hisao, you&rsquo;re in the room next to the
kitchen, which means you&rsquo;re on morning coffee duty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m changing into my bikini now~&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ummm, yeah, not gonna lie but I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to seeing this
since she mentioned going shopping on Friday. I go through the door Suzu
pointed out to me and find a large room with a bed which looks <i>much</i>
more comfortable than the one at Yamaku. I grab swimming shorts and a
t-shirt from my case and change quickly enough to be back in the hall in
time to see Miki sashaying down the stairs wearing&#x2026; Well it&rsquo;s
<i>technically</i> decent but oh my! That warm yellow is set off perfectly by
her tanned skin and those ties! I imagine pulling them slowly, the bows
unravelling, the top coming undone&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop drooling Hisao!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I look around and see Suzu smirking at me. &ldquo;You have to admit it looks
stunning on her!&rdquo; She&rsquo;s looking pretty good in her bikini too. It&rsquo;s the
same colour as her hair with a plunge neckline which makes the most of
her figure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This old thing?&rdquo; Miki laughs as she throws an arm around each of us and
breathes in ostentatiously.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s my turn to smirk. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s drooling now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu giggles, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right, she <i>does</i> look stunning. Are you two OK
with having a lazy afternoon around the house? I&rsquo;m still a bit zonked
out, I&rsquo;d rather not risk another attack of the sleepies and need hauling
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki nods, &ldquo;yeah that suits me fine. Come on, let&rsquo;s not rot inside, I
ain&rsquo;t going back more pale than when I left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We walk through the kitchen into the backyard. It&rsquo;s beautifully
maintained with immaculate lawns, a patio with outdoor seating, and a
corner shaded by a gorgeous black pine. Miki heads to the lawns closely
followed by Suzu who spreads out the towels she&rsquo;s carrying and offers me
a bottle of suncream. &ldquo;Would you mind? She makes such a fuss when I ask
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s not easy doing that one handed and I hate getting all gunky!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nod and take the bottle. Suzu smiles her thanks and lies on her
stomach while I do my best to give her an even coating. I can&rsquo;t help
noticing that her skin is smooth and warm but she doesn&rsquo;t have the
layers of muscle Miki has. She feels different but far from unpleasant.
Finishing, I look up to see Miki sprawled on her side, head propped on
her stump, smiling at me. &ldquo;Do you want me to do you too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so, shouldn&rsquo;t risk this glorious hide!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, she&rsquo;s iron under velvet compared to Suzu who&rsquo;s soft and yielding.
Somehow I manage to complete the task without undoing those tempting
ties on her bikini. I steal a kiss and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be reading by that
tree, it&rsquo;s too bright here to concentrate. Enjoy the sun, ladies!&rdquo;

I wake in the late afternoon and the girls are nowhere to be seen, the
rumbling noises my stomach is making probably drove them inside. I head
into the kitchen and look around for easy things to cook. I have a fair
few B-kyu gurume recipes at my fingertips due to being left to my own
devices for much of my teens. I find ingredients to make the infamous
Nakai Tofu Omurice and get busy.
</p>

<p>
The rice ready, I&rsquo;m about to make the omelettes when I feel arms
encircling my waist, a body pressing against my back, a kiss on my neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a life-saver! I was about to <i>die</i> of hunger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I lean back into the hug with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be finished in a couple of
minutes. Is Suzu OK?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, I brought her in when I noticed she&rsquo;d dropped off. Overdone Suzu
is nothing you want to be around!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a laugh I set the tamagoyaki pan on the hob and beat some eggs
while it heats. By the time I&rsquo;ve completed the first two, Miki returns
with a sleepy Suzu in tow. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s yours, I&rsquo;ll be in when mine&rsquo;s done.
Do you know where the ketchup is Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll take it through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m greeted by a chorus of thanks as I walk into the dining area. Suzu&rsquo;s
made a good start on her&rsquo;s while Miki&rsquo;s plate is empty and gleaming,
looking suspiciously like she&rsquo;s licked it clean.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was really tasty Hisao, but as you know I&rsquo;m a woman-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;-with insatiable appetites. Yeah, I made you secondsies.&rdquo; The look of
relief on her face as I give her another portion of food is comical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to hate life when your metabolism slows down,&rdquo; Suzu says
in amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem as long as I keep running, muscle takes a lot
of upkeep. I think I&rsquo;ll have some space left for dessert, whatcha got
Hisao?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I shrug, &ldquo;I got nothing. Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me dig around, there&rsquo;s probably something sweet in a cupboard
somewhere.&rdquo; She collects our plates and sets off to the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This place is really impressive, what do Suzu&rsquo;s parents do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re related to <i>those</i> Suzukis, old man Osamu might be tight with
the company purse strings but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to apply to family. She
hasn&rsquo;t turned out too bad for someone who gets everything she wants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dunno Miki, the way she was talking about her family made me think
they don&rsquo;t have much of a relationship. I know I don&rsquo;t see much of mine
but I feel&#x2026;loved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Same. Mum was broken up when my dad insisted I go to Yamaku, pretty
sure he only put his foot down &lsquo;cos he felt guilty. Hey, do you want to
come and meet her? I&rsquo;ll be going back home later in the holidays and
Suzu usually tags along, one extra won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Errr, well yeah, but what&rsquo;ll she think about <i>us</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gonna tell her the whole story! When I say we&rsquo;re dating, she&rsquo;ll
be glad that Suzu&rsquo;s around to keep an eye on us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re still laughing when Suzu reappears carrying a tray with tea and
some rakugan. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The thought of you being our chaperone when we visit my mum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh we&rsquo;re going to see her again this summer? Good, Miyuki&rsquo;s awesome.
How about a trip to your parents&rsquo; place Hisao? We could do a grand
tour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can ask, fitting all of us in the house will be a challenge but I&rsquo;m
sure my mum&rsquo;ll find a way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If only you had your driving licence, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to stick to
train schedules!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, message received loud and clear. I&rsquo;ll look into lessons as
soon as we get back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make ourselves comfortable while we eat these, maybe there&rsquo;ll be
something not too awful on telly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a forlorn hope so after some channel hopping we settle on a music
station in the background as we chat about anything and nothing: school
gossip, holiday plans&#x2026;everything but what we need to talk about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry guys, the narcolepsy is really kicking my butt today. I know
we&rsquo;re supposed to be sorting things out but I can&rsquo;t concentrate on what
I want to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No biggie princess. I haven&rsquo;t seen you like this for ages, any idea why
it&rsquo;s so bad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s because the last couple of weeks have been intense and
I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself through with a little help from Nurse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You on the modiodal again? I&rsquo;m gonna have words with that fucker when
we get back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Calm down Miki! Yes, I had a strictly limited supply of a mild
stimulant that&rsquo;s less addictive than caffeine. You know he wouldn&rsquo;t have
prescribed it for me if it does more harm than good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki&rsquo;s reaction has piqued my interest. &ldquo;Is it only that stuff you don&rsquo;t
approve of or is it medicine in general?&rdquo; I have a horrible thought.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not an anti-vaxxer are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, sounds painful. I just think putting
unnecessary chemicals in your body is not the way to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu snorts. &ldquo;The woman who&rsquo;d live off pizza and burgers given half a
chance is worried about what she puts into her body?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chemicals! I googled that shit last time you were on it, apparently
they don&rsquo;t even understand how it fucking works!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You looked it up? For me? You hate using computers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go getting all mushy, I was just trying to find out what I&rsquo;d be
dealing with when it messed you up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you were.&rdquo; Suzu leans in and kisses her tenderly. &ldquo;Thank-you
for caring about me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve never seen Miki so embarrassed! &ldquo;If you tried that with my meds
you&rsquo;d be there all day.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s blushing now. &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake, is it so hard to believe I&rsquo;d want to know about the
crap you two are dealing with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve asked, we&rsquo;d have talked you through it, right Hisao?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Umm&#x2026;oh hell, why not? &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t really discussed my issues with
anyone but I think I&rsquo;m ready to tell you about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK OK, I get the message, we&rsquo;ll add it to the list. Not tonight tho&rsquo;,
it&rsquo;s not only Suzu who looks like an extra from a zombie movie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
My afternoon nap helped but Suzu&rsquo;s right about how hectic it&rsquo;s been,
it&rsquo;ll be a few more lazy days before I&rsquo;m running on full again. &ldquo;You OK
getting to your room Suzu?&rdquo; When she nods I stand up and say, &ldquo;What
about training in the morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nah, let yourself sleep through, we&rsquo;ll take it from there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See you tomorrow then, sleep well.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
After a good night&rsquo;s sleep in the most comfortable bed I&rsquo;ve ever had the
pleasure of using, I walk into the kitchen and see Suzu holding a folded
piece of paper. &ldquo;Good morning! What have you got there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Morning Hisao. I was looking for coffee but found this note, it&rsquo;s
addressed to both of us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I peer over her shoulder when she opens it and recognise Miki&rsquo;s
<i>distinctive</i> hand-writing. It says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>If we&rsquo;re gonna do this we&rsquo;re gonna do it right. Not me and Suzu, me
and Hisao. The three of us sharing</i> everything. <i>I&rsquo;m giving you two some</i>
<i>time alone and a care package, you&rsquo;ll find what you need in there to
make this isosceles triangle equilateral. If you don&rsquo;t have</i>
<i>shit-eating grins on your faces when I get back, we&rsquo;re done</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Who knew Miki paid attention in geometry class? &ldquo;Does she mean what I
think she means?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t bring myself to meet Suzu&rsquo;s gaze but from the
corner of my eye I see her nodding, her face as red as mine feels.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So this is why she&rsquo;s been on edge, I thought it was exams but I
should&rsquo;ve known better. I reckon swapping between us was bringing back
bad memories of her dad. Which is fair enough, it&rsquo;s not what I intended
either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What does she mean by that? I notice a shoebox on the worktop which
wasn&rsquo;t there when I went to bed so I open it. &ldquo;I wonder what she&rsquo;s left
for us.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a bottle of lube, some condoms, a scented candle
and&#x2026;is that a pair of handcuffs? What the hell?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hisao.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I turn to see an uncertain expression on Suzu&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only ever been with Miki, I don&rsquo;t really know what to do with a
boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait, we&rsquo;re doing this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not much compared to her, I&rsquo;ll understand if you&rsquo;re not
interested.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was <i>not</i> what I meant. &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not&#x2026; When I said I was OK
with sharing I meant I would give you two some space. I didn&rsquo;t expect
<i>this</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dreamed about us all being together properly and honestly Hisao,
it&rsquo;s <i>so</i> good and I&rsquo;m not even talking about the sex. That&rsquo;s why I made
such a nuisance of myself, I was trying to make it happen. It looks like
it&rsquo;s what Miki wants too. The question is, what do <i>you</i> want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I want to be with Miki. I&rsquo;m fond of Suzu but I&rsquo;m not sure about being in
a relationship with her too, I&rsquo;m still getting used to having a
girlfriend! Then again, aren&rsquo;t we already in a relationship? The three
of us do most things together, decide things together. How different
would it be to the way it is now? Apart from the obvious&#x2026; I don&rsquo;t know
what Suzu&rsquo;s been dreaming but I&rsquo;d say we work well as a group, it only
gets awkward around bedtime. Miki&rsquo;s spent a lot of nights alone
recently, I guess I understand why now.
</p>

<p>
Instead of rushing into something for fear of losing Miki, I need to
think this through carefully. I need to have positive reasons. Even if
it means breaking up with Miki? We&rsquo;d break up anyway if I force myself
do something I&rsquo;m not comfortable with. It&rsquo;d make Miki happy and Suzu
just said it&rsquo;s what she wanted all along, are they enough positives?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well Hisao, do you like what you see?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I realise I&rsquo;ve been staring at her all this time. <i>Do</i> I like what I
see? Miki lights a fire inside me, my feelings for her are fierce and
hot. It&rsquo;s not that way with Suzu, I feel&#x2026;protective? Not exactly,
she&rsquo;s too independent for that, but I want to be there when she needs
someone. When I&rsquo;m with Miki, Suzu&rsquo;s the first person I look for as I
enter a room; when I&rsquo;m not she&rsquo;s the second. I feel at ease around her,
even when her narcolepsy forces her to tune us out. Looking at her
without being blinded by Miki I can see how cute she is. Her messy hair
suits her perfectly and that adorable nose is just crying out for boops,
those lips for kisses. The t-shirt she slept in is clinging to her in
interesting ways&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much. But I wouldn&rsquo;t, umm, <i>share</i> with you just because you&rsquo;re
cute or to avoid breaking up with Miki, I&rsquo;m too fond of you for that. I
haven&rsquo;t thought about you in that way before now, I&rsquo;ve been focused on
Miki, but I&rsquo;m realising there&rsquo;s a lot of things about you I&rsquo;m attracted
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ve thought about <i>you</i> that way. I&rsquo;m not saying you make me go
weak at the knees but I&rsquo;d like you to be my first boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No pressure then! Do I actually have any reasons for <i>not</i> doing this? I
know I care for Suzu and I&rsquo;m starting to see how desirable she is in her
own right. It&rsquo;s hardly socially acceptable, but as long as we don&rsquo;t make
a spectacle of ourselves we can probably get away with it. It would make
two of my favourite people in the world happier and I get to have sex
with another girl without my girlfriend killing me. When you put it like
that&#x2026; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been with Miki too, I don&rsquo;t really know what to do
with a Suzu.&rdquo; She laughs, I&rsquo;m glad she seems a bit less nervous, makes
me feel less nervous too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll work it out together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I take a deep breath and hold out my arms for a hug. She&rsquo;s in them like
a flash, holding me tight with a quiet sigh of relief. She&rsquo;s small,
thinner than Miki&#x2026; No, stop comparing them. This is Suzu, I should
concentrate on being with <i>her</i>. I pick her up like a princess, carry
her into my room and sit on the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ooh very manly Hisao!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s a cute giggle. I didn&rsquo;t realise she&rsquo;s so agile, she&rsquo;s straddled
my waist and locked her legs around me. This feels exciting, her t-shirt
is riding up, she&rsquo;s not wearing much else. I kiss her, she holds me
tighter, opens her mouth to invite my tongue in. I&rsquo;m happy to oblige.
She tastes sweet, like the energy drink she&rsquo;s always guzzling. This is
good, she&rsquo;s really into it, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> really into it. I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d
be this forceful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ve warmed up to the idea, let&rsquo;s get this off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh no, that&rsquo;s <i>not</i> good, she&rsquo;s unbuttoning my pyjama jacket. The scar!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hisao? You&rsquo;ve gone all stiff and not in a good way. What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know about my heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They made a bit of a mess of me when they operated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;ll make you feel more relaxed&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I gasp as she tugs her t-shirt off leaving her in just a pair of green
striped panties. Her breasts are small but perky, the nipples standing
out against her pale skin. I can&rsquo;t resist, I take one in my mouth and
run my tongue around it, sucking gently. Going by the noises she&rsquo;s
making I&rsquo;d say she enjoys this as much as Miki does. There goes my top.
I really don&rsquo;t care about my scar right now, I&rsquo;m more concerned with how
tight my pants suddenly are.
</p>

<p>
I manoeuvre her so she&rsquo;s lying on her back, she&rsquo;s still got her legs
wrapped around me, rubbing herself against me, moaning softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hisao, I need more&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I shift again, unwrapping her legs so I can lie on my side. I kiss her
hard, tongues fighting, and trail my hand down her body, circle my
fingers round her belly button. She groans and struggles out of her
panties, pushes my hand between her thighs. Aggressive! I feel a
familiar, addictive slickness as I part her lips. Her clit is hard, more
prominent than Miki&rsquo;s, and she shivers when I apply a little pressure to
the hood. She&rsquo;s very wet, we won&rsquo;t be needing the lube. Condoms! Damn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; she asks as I start to get up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I left the condoms in the kitchen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Smoooooth. Hurry up or I&rsquo;ll finish without you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m back in a flash and take the opportunity to discard the rest of my
pyjamas. Suzu grasps me and giggles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot! And hard, and a bit squishy. Get that condom on, I want to
feel what it&rsquo;s like inside me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it hurt? You said it&rsquo;s your first time with a boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another giggle. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the first time I&rsquo;ve been&#x2026;penetrated. I
bet you&rsquo;re not as rough as Miki is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki&rsquo;s rough? She&rsquo;s pretty laid back with me. I position myself between
her legs and she reaches down to guide me. She lets out a happy sigh as
I push all the way in and wraps herself around me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mmmm I like how close we are, it&rsquo;s cuddling but better!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, but she&rsquo;s got such a strong hold on me that I can&rsquo;t
really&#x2026;/thrust/. OK Hisao, if you can&rsquo;t move in one dimension, try the
others. I circle my hips which makes her moan in pleasure and grip me
even harder. It feels good to be in her, tight and hot, but it sounds
like she&rsquo;s enjoying it more than I am. That&rsquo;s fine, there&rsquo;s nothing
wrong with making our first time all about her. I speed up a little, add
some extra pressure. She gasps and shudders, bites my shoulder. I study
her reactions, investigate how different angles or changes in pace make
her react. Suddenly she contracts and the force she exerts deep inside
has me flinching.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ahhh Hisao, stop, please&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sorry sorry, are you OK?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I just get really sensitive after I&#x2026;you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Heh, mission accomplished. I withdraw carefully and lie on my back, arms
around her. She nestles in to me, rests her head on my chest and plays
with my hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was <i>very</i> good; different, but good. Being able to hold you close
felt wonderful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you <i>are</i> a notorious snuggle bunny!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laughs. &ldquo;Is it supposed to stay hard?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, errrr, finish yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D-didn&rsquo;t I make you feel good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t let her think she&rsquo;s done something wrong. &ldquo;It felt great! I was
concentrating on you though, I wanted it to be special for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She kisses me deeply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lovely boy Hisao, the only other person
who cares for me like you do is Miki. She says I have clever hands,
let&rsquo;s see if you think so too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I feel her take hold of me, tentatively at first but with more
confidence as my reactions show her I&rsquo;m enjoying her touch. I&rsquo;m starting
to understand what she likes about this closeness. The sensation of her
body against mine, her breasts pressed against my chest, the smell of
her hair, combined with the steady rhythm she&rsquo;s established means I&rsquo;m
reaching my limit fast. Wait, what?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Err Suzu, is anything wrong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She giggles and kisses me. &ldquo;Deal with it Hisao, endure a little bit of
torment now to have a higher high later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The third time she brings me to the brink is almost painful, my hips are
bucking and I&rsquo;m moaning. She sits up and I feel a warm wetness which
sends me over the edge. When I can think again I find Suzu in my arms,
resting a hand on my heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just realised that might not have been the best idea&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miki&rsquo;s made sure my heart won&rsquo;t give out so easily.&rdquo; Why&rsquo;s she raising
her eyebrows at me? Oh. &ldquo;The running! This is the fittest I&rsquo;ve ever been
and you didn&rsquo;t do anything sudden, it was all gradual build up. Where
did you learn to do that? You said I&rsquo;m the first boy you&rsquo;ve been with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very different from what I do with Miki, though I don&rsquo;t
usually let her off so easy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That was being let off <i>easy</i>?!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly about being observant, seeing what builds pleasure, gauging
how close you are to the point of no return. Your reactions weren&rsquo;t hard
to read so staying in control of you was straightforward. Do you know
what <i>mudita</i> means?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s something my Buddhist grandma talked about but I can&rsquo;t
dredge up a definition from my memory so I shake my head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The delight you take in others&rsquo; joy. Making you react that way was
truly satisfying, I feel like I understand you better now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think I could do that? It&rsquo;d be nice to return the favour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you can, as I said it&rsquo;s all about paying attention. But I
don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s too much for me. I get so sensitive it hurts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you like instead?&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s suddenly blushing!
&ldquo;Really? After what we&rsquo;ve just done, how we&rsquo;ve been talking, asking what
I can do for you is embarrassing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly&#x2026;it&rsquo;s just&#x2026;what I want might sound weird.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Try me. You didn&rsquo;t judge my scar, I&rsquo;m not going to judge you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to pleasure both of you at the same time, see if I can make you
finish simultaneously.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I give her a little squeeze. &ldquo;Yeah, I get you wanting that. How would it
even work though?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She giggles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a couple of ideas. When Miki gets back, do you
want to try them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A watched kettle never boils when you and your new lover are in need of
coffee. I know that&rsquo;s not a saying, but it should be. While I wait, I&rsquo;m
daydreaming about what I&rsquo;ve been doing with Suzu when the door to the
backyard opens and a sweaty Miki walks in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I do my best approximation of a shit-eating grin, she punches me
on the shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smirk at me, this is important!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oops. &ldquo;It was supposed to be a shit-eating grin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What? Oh! Fuck yeah!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there&rsquo;s a sobbing girl in my arms. &ldquo;Hey hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ve never seen her like this before, she seems overcome and relieved at
the same time. She draws back a little and I look at her snotty, tear
stained face. I guess it must be love if she&rsquo;s beautiful to me even in
this state.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was scared you wouldn&rsquo;t do it, that we&rsquo;d be finished and I&rsquo;d never
get with either of you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I feel Suzu join the hug and Miki leans over to kiss her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eww Miki, you&rsquo;re gross! Have you been running yourself to death again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit fragrant too princess! Hisao gave you a workout eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish, more like I&rsquo;ve been doing the hard work while he lies back and
enjoys himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That&rsquo;s not how I remember it, but OK.

Suzu flicks the note which is still sitting on the worktop. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
saying I disagree with the results, but what brought this on? Thinking
about your dad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, my head understood I wasn&rsquo;t sneaking around behind anyone&rsquo;s back
but my heart wasn&rsquo;t convinced. It was eating me up and this was the
first chance I&rsquo;ve had to do anything about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you <i>say</i> something? You were taking a pretty big risk, what
if we&rsquo;d read that and locked ourselves in our rooms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you couldn&rsquo;t balance out this triangle then it was dead in the
water. You might think it was fun to have my pick of partners but it
fucking sucked. Whenever I chose one the other acted like a hurt puppy.
No, don&rsquo;t look at me like that, you know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I glance guiltily at Suzu who nods ruefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was giving you the opportunity to get it on when I left early those
nights, but you dumbasses went to bed alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I sigh in exasperation. &ldquo;How the hell were we supposed to know that&rsquo;s
what you were doing? Suzu&rsquo;s right, you should&rsquo;ve said something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not so good with words. I understand what I&rsquo;m feeling but
when I try to say it, it comes out scrambled and I end up wanting to hit
stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s done now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, how was it? You didn&rsquo;t do it just to keep me sweet? There&rsquo;s
some&#x2026;thing between you that&rsquo;d make you want to do it again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I nod, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;ve thought through how I feel about her, properly looked
at her, it turns out I&rsquo;m kinda attracted to her. It was good,
educational actually.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu giggles and pats my cheek affectionately. &ldquo;You always were a bit
slow Hisao, but I&rsquo;m willing to forgive you since you performed
adequately.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah. &lsquo;Oh Hisao, stop, I am undone by your manly prowess!&rsquo; &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Joining in the laughter, I realise how much I&rsquo;ve missed joking around
like this. Miki sets the mood and she&rsquo;s been stressed out so it makes
sense that we&rsquo;ve been a little downbeat recently. Now there&rsquo;s a
joyfulness about us, as if the cork&rsquo;s been popped and we&rsquo;re fizzing all
over the place. Suzu certainly popped <i>my</i> cork!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s investigate the new bathroom your parents have had put
in. There&rsquo;s enough shower heads for all of us and a <i>huge</i> hot tub!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu pouts, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want a huge tub. How am I supposed to get cuddles if
you&rsquo;re all spread out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I kiss her on the top of the head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay close, can&rsquo;t have you
being cuddle-deprived! When we&rsquo;ve finished soaking, are you going to run
your experiment?&rdquo; Seeing a puzzled look from Miki I say, &ldquo;Suzu has a
theory about what she&rsquo;d like instead of that&#x2026;teasing thing she does,
but she needs both of us to try it out.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help laughing at the
enormous grin which threatens to split Miki&rsquo;s face in half and let
myself be dragged upstairs.
</p>

<p>
As I go to meet my fate I have a sudden feeling of completeness, which
is weird because I had no idea there was anything missing from my life.
With the filling of a Suzu-shaped hole comes the realisation that, for
the first time since my heart attack, I&rsquo;m excited about where my future
will take me, will take <i>us</i>: I can&rsquo;t imagine going there without them.
