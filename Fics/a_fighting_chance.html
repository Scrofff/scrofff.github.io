<h1 class="title">Tokyo nightlife</h1>
<p>
Kōki looks around the rabbit warren of streets on the edge of Tokyo&rsquo;s
Shimokitazawa district, trying to spot the bar that Miki had chosen for
their night out. As always when in public he is conscious of his size,
uncomfortable with the attention that his height and bulk attract. He is
careful to avoid jostling the other pedestrians, his movements as
controlled and precise as a dancer&rsquo;s as he searches for some sign of his
destination. A shout away to his left catches his attention and he sees
a drunk man stumbling out of a bar, colliding with passersby who voice
their displeasure. A dimly lit sign announces that the bar is called The
Shanghai.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really Miki?&rdquo; he says under his breath as he heads towards the
entrance. The low doorway forces him to duck and when he straightens he
spots her at a corner table giving him a cheeky grin. Waving, he walks
over and carefully sits down, ready for the stool to give way under his
weight. When it shows no sign of doing so he sighs and says, &ldquo;well Miki,
you certainly found a&#x2026; <i>colourful</i> place to meet!&rdquo; He looks around at
the dimly lit room, the nicotine yellow ceiling and shabby posters on
the walls, the gaudy splash of light coming from the beer pumps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Its got character and the beer&rsquo;s cheap, dive in.&rdquo; She gestures to the
pitcher and empty mug sitting on table next to her half-filled mug.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a tea house with the same name close to my old school so I
wanted to check it out, but the service here is bad enough to make me
want Yuuko back!&rdquo; She waves away his puzzled look. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you
big man, missed you last month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suspect you were far too busy for that to be true, but I appreciate
the sentiment. Congratulations on being selected for the world
championships!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She grimaces, &ldquo;thanks, it was only supposed to be for the relay but I
ended up being subbed into the hurdles too. I fucking <i>hate</i> the
hurdles!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Only&rsquo; she says! Weren&rsquo;t you the youngest member of the team? A
massive achievement if you ask me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, a step in the right direction. Congratulations to you too,
rocking the second division these days!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He chuckles, &ldquo;thank-you! I feel like I&rsquo;ve got the measure of most of the
other rikishi in the division, though it&rsquo;s still a big step to the next.
I got a pretty brutal lesson in sumo from one of the yokozuna at the
last tournament.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still, it shows that the Professional Sports Association can&rsquo;t spot
talent. That baseball player who beat us to the best newcomer award last
year is nowhere to be seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Still brooding about that Miki? As far as I&rsquo;m concerned it was just a
free dinner and a very welcome opportunity to make a new friend.&rdquo; He
bows his head to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The food wasn&rsquo;t even that good but I guess the friend I found doesn&rsquo;t
totally suck,&rdquo; she laughs. &ldquo;But seriously, I really appreciate being
close to someone who&rsquo;s also an athlete, Hisao and Suzu are pretty low
energy.&rdquo; Seeing concern starting to appear on his face she says, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
get me wrong, I love them to bits. I absolutely need that calmness in my
life but it&rsquo;s great to blow off a bit of steam sometimes. They really
wouldn&rsquo;t approve of the sort of pranks we get caught up in&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know how much longer we&rsquo;ll keep getting away with it
though, both of us are starting to get coverage in the sports pages and
it&rsquo;s a short step from there to being on the radar of the tabloid
journalists.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can do without that, I resent anything that distracts me. All I want
is to get on with training so I can keep winning. Prime example, my
agent is pressuring me to go to a photo-shoot for one of the teen mags,
fuckers want to dress me up all girly. I <i>hate</i> that shit, I never look
right. Give me training kit any day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look great in anything! You&rsquo;re just wearing jeans and a tank top
and you&rsquo;re the best looking woman here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kōki, I&rsquo;m the <i>only</i> woman in this bar!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A mere technicality. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where we go, the women hate you
for looking so good and the men hate me for being with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sighs, &ldquo;I appreciate what you&rsquo;re trying to do but I just don&rsquo;t get
it. When I see pictures of myself all I see is what&rsquo;s wrong, starting
with this.&rdquo; She holds up her stump.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miki, listen! You&rsquo;re beautiful by any standard, you must be the only
person in the world who can&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this a play to get into my pants Kōki? You know I&rsquo;m taken,&rdquo; she says
in amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;re beautiful, not that I&rsquo;m attracted to you. Like a tree or
a poem&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah but I doubt you&rsquo;d want to fuck a tree or a poem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fuck you either!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make your mind up big man, you say I&rsquo;m sexy but you don&rsquo;t want to get
it on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Beautiful</i>, what&rsquo;s so hard to understand about that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So what does float your boat?&rdquo; Miki asks, her interest piqued. He
trides to hide behind his beer mug, hoping his blush goes unnoticed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some of the female rikishi, is that more your speed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miki! No, I&#x2026;look it&rsquo;s all hypothetical anyway, I&rsquo;m never going to
attract anyone looking like <i>this</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so bad, you&rsquo;ve got the whole rugged thing going on. Wait til
you get promoted a few more times, you&rsquo;ll be beating the girls off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I want! I want something genuine, loving. I&rsquo;m quite
envious of what you have, I was a bit surprised when I worked it out but
it&rsquo;s so stable, so supportive, so much love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Surprised&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t describe the look on your face when you cottoned
on! We&rsquo;re glad you figured it out, it didn&rsquo;t feel right hiding it but I
couldn&rsquo;t work out how to tell you. You know Suzu adores you? She&rsquo;s
always asking when her teddy bear is going to visit again. I think Hisao
was intimidated by you to start with but you did that manly bonding over
sport teams thing,&rdquo; she says with a roll of her eyes. &ldquo;And stop trying
to change the subject, you still haven&rsquo;t said what you&rsquo;re into. You know
my sordid secrets so it&rsquo;s only fair you share some of yours.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sighs, &ldquo;look Miki, this isn&rsquo;t something I have any experience with.
Sumo is my whole life, the only thing I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do, the only
thing I&rsquo;m <i>good</i> at. When the head of the Association said there&rsquo;s no
homosexuality in sumo it wasn&rsquo;t an assessment of the situation, it was a
threat&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh shit Kōki, that sucks. I&rsquo;m sorry for teasing you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nods, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no realistic possibility of me having a relationship
so I try not to think about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been rubbing your nose in it? It seems
unfair that I&rsquo;ve got Suzu and Hisao and you&rsquo;ve got no-one,&rdquo; Miki asks
hesitantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course not. I didn&rsquo;t say anything about my personal life, how could
you have known? I&rsquo;ve wanted to but I was worried about damaging our
friendship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Idiot.&rdquo; She punches him on the shoulder. &ldquo;What the hell made you think
I would have a problem with that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you would, I said that I was <i>worried</i> that you would. I
get a lot of irrational thoughts bouncing around in my head whenever I
try to think about relationships or the future.&rdquo; He bows his head. &ldquo;To
tell the truth I&rsquo;m almost ready to call it quits and do something else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the hell?!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only my personal situation, it&rsquo;s the scandals and the cheating
too. I <i>hate</i> feeling like the public is looking at me and wondering if
I&rsquo;m throwing matches for the Yakuza or having drug-fueled orgies every
ten minutes. Last tournament one of the ozeki tried to bribe me to throw
a match so he could stay on the gravy train a bit longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;Your response?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dumped the bastard on his arse in two seconds flat, perfect nichonage
if I say so myself. There&rsquo;s a lot of less overt pressure too. If I get
my eight wins early in a tournament I start getting suggestions to take
it easy, give myself time to recover, don&rsquo;t let poor so-and-so be
demoted &lsquo;cos his mother is ill in hospital&#x2026; It&rsquo;s endless and I hate
it. It&rsquo;s not what sumo is supposed to be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki takes one of his huge arms and hugs it tight. &ldquo;I understand. Marion
fucking Jones was my idol when I was a kid, turns out she was rotten to
the core. Devastated me. But you know what I did? What I <i>do</i>? I try
harder. Every time I set foot on a track I try to prove that you can win
clean.&rdquo; She puts her palm on his cheek and gently turns his face so she
can look him in the eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it in you to be the first home
grown yokozuna this century, the greatest since Chiyonofuji. Are you
seriously gonna let that go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well ain&rsquo;t this cute, a fat man and a cripple getting it on in the back
of my bar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They turn to see a drunk man laughing in their direction. He&rsquo;s wearing
black leather jeans and matching leather jacket with patches declaring
allegiance to an out of town street gang sewn on to it.
</p>

<p>
Miki snorts derisively, &ldquo;no way this is your bar pretty boy, go back to
your farm before you make even more of a fool of yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looks like you&rsquo;re the one making a fool of herself. Ditch the ogre and
we&rsquo;ll show you a good time.&rdquo; He gestures to three similarly dressed men
standing behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you country boys one last chance. Fuck off and leave us alone
and you&rsquo;ll stay out of trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mouthy bitch needs a lesso-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki <i>explodes</i> into action. The speed she moves does not surprise Kōki,
they have trained together and she has helped him improve his tachi-ai,
the opening charge of a sumo bout. It is her total commitment to action
that shocks him, the intense focus on her goal, the way she ignores
anything that is <i>not</i> her goal. He recognises it as an important lesson
that he will need time to reflect on &#x2013; time that he does not have as he
moves to protect Miki&rsquo;s back.
</p>

<p>
She grabs the would-be hard man by the throat and starts punching him in
the face with her stump. Kōki sees that she can handle him so
concentrates on controlling the other three using leg sweeps and throws
to put them down and open-handed strikes to encourage them to stay down.
He is careful not to hurt them badly but the weight of his blows is far
greater than they had experienced in street brawls against weaker
opponents and the fight soon leaves them. When he steps back warily they
take the opportunity to scramble to their feet and run to the door,
yelling to their leader. Realising that he is now outnumbered as well as
outclassed, he pushes Miki into Kōki and follows them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come back you bastards! I&rsquo;ll beat you with one hand tied behind my
back!&rdquo; Miki yells as they disappear out of the bar. They stop and stare
at each other, realising it was a ridiculous thing for a one-handed
woman to say, and burst out laughing as they lean against a wall to
catch their breath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So Kōki, where are you taking me next month? You&rsquo;re gonna have to go
some to top this!&rdquo;
