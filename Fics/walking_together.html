<h1 class="title">Walking together</h1>
<p>
“Is there anything that needs special attention today, or shall I just do
the usual?” Hisao asks, rubbing his hands together to warm the massage
oil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Left calf, fucker&rsquo;s sore as hell after those practice starts,&rdquo; Miki
groans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yeah, there&rsquo;s a knot the size of a golf ball.&rdquo; He works on it
carefully, easing the tension out of the muscle. &ldquo;Is your lower back
holding up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yep your magic fingers did the trick, as always.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao decided to learn some sports massage to show his appreciation to
Miki for taking over his training, though he only found the courage to
offer his services when she limped off the track one evening. She was
surprised by how effective it was and it became a part of their daily
routine, soothing the aches and pains caused by her rigorous schedule.
The trust and closeness they shared during these times carried over into
their everyday lives and their romance blossomed. As Miki put it,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had your hands all over me for weeks, we might as well make it
official.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Some think them a mismatched couple but they each fulfil a need in the
other. Hisao&rsquo;s protective urges are satisfied by taking care of her
physical niggles. Miki&rsquo;s body image issues, a remnant of the accident
that took her hand, are eased by the delight he takes in pampering her.
</p>

<p>
Miki can tell that Hisao has finished the therapeutic phase of the
massage because his hands have started to stray to areas unaffected by
her training. She sits up and pulls him into a kiss. &ldquo;Hands off the
goods lover boy, we&rsquo;ve got a movie to catch.&rdquo; She laughs at his
disappointed groan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hole up tomorrow with plenty of food and a
big bottle of lube, and if I&rsquo;m not walking funny on Monday morning I&rsquo;ll
be <i>very</i> disappointed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao chuckles as he dresses. &ldquo;What has Molly found for us this week?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says its a classic of French experimental cinema. Its a good job I
enjoy the company, her taste in movies is crap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yours isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oi!&rdquo; she says, clouting him with her stump, &ldquo;Chariots of Fire is a
<i>classic</i>. Let&rsquo;s go, she&rsquo;ll be cross if we miss the bus.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Molly looks proudly at the members of her cinema club as they disembark in the city centre. Technically speaking its not an actual club, nor is it her&rsquo;s.  Nevertheless she is committed to searching out cinematic gems for their weekly outings, whether they like it or not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any pre-film words for us this week Molly?&rdquo; Hisao asks. &ldquo;Any obscure
symbolism or visual metaphors to look out for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather you went into this one without any preconceptions to
colour your experience,&rdquo; she replies airily.
</p>

<p>
Suzu looks at her in suspicion. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen it, have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, is that Ikuno over there?&rdquo; Molly asks, keen to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
They look across the busy street and see a girl in Yamaku uniform
accompanied by a greying man in a dark suit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; says Miki, waving.
</p>

<p>
Ikuno looks startled when she sees them, waves back then walks off,
seemingly in a hurry. After a few moments the man gives them a shallow
nod and walks after her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve ever seen her with one of her parents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Its the first time I&rsquo;ve seen her outside of the <i>classroom</i>,&rdquo; Suzu
adds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not saying much,&rdquo; Molly retorts. &ldquo;She could be parading around
in her underwear and you wouldn&rsquo;t notice, if you were concentrating on
staying awake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harsh but fair,&rdquo; Suzu agrees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Creepy,&rdquo; Rin says in her deadpan voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Staring at my arms and your legs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stare at what&rsquo;s not there.&rdquo; Molly replies, puzzled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why was she still wearing her uniform? I always dress up when my
parents take me somewhere expensive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not everyone&rsquo;s folks can afford to take them to fancy places,
princess,&rdquo; Miki snorts.
</p>

<p>
Suzu sticks her tongue out at Miki. &ldquo;Whatever. Come on, the movie&rsquo;s
starting soon. Can&rsquo;t miss the beginning!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would never do,&rdquo; Hisao says under his breath, following them with
a resigned step as they set off towards the arts picture house.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Well at least it ended with a bang, there weren&rsquo;t many other laughs to be had,&rdquo; Miki says on the short walk from the bus stop to the dorms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t meant to be <i>funny</i>!&rdquo; Molly replies in exasperation. &ldquo;It
was a metaphor for how indecision can have disastrous consequences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a series of beautiful paintings interspersed with meaningless
narrative.&rdquo; Rin nods to herself, content with her analysis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&#x2026; actually makes sense,&rdquo; Suzu says in wonder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of season track meet next week and I&rsquo;m going to the
after-party with Hisao. Are you guys going to come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am, it&rsquo;ll give me extra time to find something special for our next
trip!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ll be there because that would be predicting the future.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rolling her eyes, Miki kisses Hisao. &ldquo;Go and get a good night&rsquo;s sleep,
I&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;round bright and early with the supplies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what she means? I don&rsquo;t know what she means. Do I <i>want</i> to
know what she means? I don&rsquo;t think I do.&rdquo; Suzu says to no-one in
particular.
</p>

<p>
Hooking an arm around Suzu&rsquo;s neck Miki says, &ldquo;let me explain <i>exactly</i>
what my plans for tomorrow are, princess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noooooo,&rdquo; Suzu shrieks, &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t recovered from the last time
you <i>explained</i> something to me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao walks away quickly, doing his best to tune out Miki&rsquo;s descriptions
and the girls&rsquo; laughter. The last thing he hears before they disappear
into their dorm is Rin asking, &ldquo;is that why Emi walks funny sometimes?&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
After a slow Monday, Hisao is enjoying the quiet of his room where they
had retreated after post-training showers. Miki is stretched out on his
bed, her skin gleaming from the massage oil. &ldquo;No aches and pains today?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shakes her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not pushing as hard, tapering down for
Saturday.&rdquo; Rolling onto her side and leaning her head on her stump she
sighs and says, &ldquo;Hisao, I&rsquo;m sad,&rdquo; with a quiver in her voice.
</p>

<p>
He frowns. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have that. I think you need a&#x2026; happy ending!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing, they pounce on each other.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The pursuit of happiness is a hungry business, so after Miki has been thoroughly comforted they head to the cafeteria.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo; &lsquo;Resting is training,&rsquo; so I&rsquo;ll sit here while you fetch something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sighing at her cheeky wink, Hisao goes to the counter and picks over the
day&rsquo;s leavings. It takes a while to find enough acceptable food for them
both.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you know that Takashi and Ikuno are seeing each other?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really? How do you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;While you were getting this <i>delicious</i> meal, he came in and sat next
to her. They talked for a bit and left holding hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought those two would be together. She seems so&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meek,&rdquo; Miki finishes for him, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s an asshole. Then again, plenty
of people think <i>we&rsquo;re</i> a weird couple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He snorts, &ldquo;based solely on blind prejudice. I think we&rsquo;re a great fit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I certainly appreciate how well you fit me!&rdquo; Grinning at the blush on
his face, she changes the subject. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling really good about
Saturday. Your handiwork lets me train harder because I&rsquo;m recovering so
fast. I&rsquo;ve never been in this sort of form before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be great to see you beat Emi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, she can stare at <i>my</i> arse for a change! My best chance is the
hundred metres, probably the two hundred as well. She&rsquo;s got the better
build for longer distances, but I&rsquo;ve got the raw power you need for the
sprints.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s for certain, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> be staring at your arse on Saturday!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing she stands up. &ldquo;Come on, time to turn in. I want you well
rested for the weekend, I intend to be doing a <i>lot</i> of celebrating!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Wednesday morning finds class 3-3 bored by one of Mutou&rsquo;s flights of
fancy. Hisao is looking at Ikuno; speculating about what she finds
attractive in Takashi is far more entertaining than what&rsquo;s going on at
the front of the class. He is interrupted by a piece of paper landing on
his desk.
</p>

<p>
[Missing your girlfriend so much you can&rsquo;t stop staring at her?]
</p>

<p>
[No was wondering what Ikuno sees in Takashi]
</p>

<p>
Shizune frowns as she reads Hisao&rsquo;s reply. [You&rsquo;d be better off ignoring
that troublesome girl.]
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s Hisao&rsquo;s turn to frown. [But she seems so quiet]
</p>

<p>
Shizune writes angrily for a while, then thrusts the paper back. [We
regularly get reports of her returning to campus after curfew. We fill
out a form for each incident but the Administration doesn&rsquo;t do anything
about her delinquent behaviour. It causes us a lot of work, it&rsquo;s
disrespectful to the school, and she&rsquo;s a bad example to the younger
students. We would be far better off if she were expelled.]
</p>

<p>
[Harsh. You must have spoken to her, did she explain what was going on?]
</p>

<p>
[She says she has family obligations to attend to, they live in the city
apparently.]
</p>

<p>
[Yeah we saw her with her father on Saturday. You should give her a
break, sounds like the poor girl has enough to deal with]
</p>

<p>
Shizune reads his reply and sneers at him. [You&rsquo;ll never get anywhere
with that weak attitude!]
</p>

<p>
Hisao shrugs and goes back to his speculation.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

</div>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;No training tonight Hisao,&rdquo; Miki announces as they leave class on Friday afternoon. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit in the sun for a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They find an unoccupied bench and settle down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you decided which events you&rsquo;ll enter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna ditch the four hundred and concentrate on the sprints.
Ritsu&rsquo;s damn near as fast as I am over that distance anyway, so I&rsquo;m not
leaving us without a good chance to gain points. I will do the relay,
but that&rsquo;s after the individual events so it won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll beat Sendai Ikuei Gakuen high school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki shrugs. &ldquo;Not my problem, that&rsquo;s for the captain to worry about.
I&rsquo;ve got enough on my plate. Their head coach is on Sendai University&rsquo;s
sports scholarship committee, if I put on a good show he&rsquo;ll remember my
name when it comes to handing them out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao looks at her in surprise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve mentioned
plans for after graduation. I was getting a bit wor-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah let&rsquo;s postpone this little chat, I&rsquo;ve got to get through tomorrow
first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Taken aback by her brusque reply, he nods. &ldquo;What can I do to help you
with that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Honestly, the best thing you can do is leave me alone till after I&rsquo;ve
raced tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t want some of that tension relieved?&rdquo; he asks with a
nudge and a wink.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>told</i> you what I want, I don&rsquo;t need a fucking debate!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK, OK, sorry&#x2026; I haven&rsquo;t done something to upset you have I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sighing, she takes his hand. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m always foul on the day before an
event, and this is the most important one so far.&rdquo; She pauses, searching
for the right words. &ldquo;I need to focus on <i>me</i> so I can perform properly,
I can&rsquo;t deal with anyone else. Just&#x2026; be there for me Hisao. Sitting in
the bleachers, staring at my arse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing, he stands up. &ldquo;Go well tomorrow Miki, not for Yamaku, not for
the track club, not even for me. Do it for yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She nods as he bends down to kiss her, then he leaves her to her
thoughts.
</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Hisao sits with Suzu, waiting for the girls&rsquo; two hundred
metres race. The four hundred metres went well for Yamaku, Emi winning
easily and Ritsu just squeezing into second place by the narrowest of
margins.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; Suzu says excitedly, tugging on his arm. &ldquo;Hisao, what
have you <i>done</i> to her? She looks <i>magnificent</i>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The comparison between Miki and the other competitors is stark. Its not
just that she is powerfully built; the striations in her muscles, thrown
into sharp relief by the sunlight, are testament to the intensity with
which she has been training.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She says the massages help her train harder. You really can see the
difference.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the girls are called to their mark Hisao starts to feel nervous. His
heart starts to race, almost as if <i>he</i> was about to compete. The wait
for the starting signal seems interminable; then it comes.
</p>

<p>
Miki <i>explodes</i> and powers round the bend, each stride a study in brutal
acceleration and flowing relaxation. The result is never in doubt;
half-way down the finishing straight she has started to ease off, saving
herself for the next race. She acknowledges the cheers with a small
smile and wave then trots off to the staging area. Emi, a distant
second, follows with a dazed expression on her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her power level was <i>way</i> over 9000,&rdquo; Suzu says, an awed expression on
her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was holding back. We&rsquo;ll have to wait until the next race to see her
go super saiyan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They wave at Molly when they spot her walking towards them. &ldquo;Hey guys! I
wanted to spend one race in Emi&rsquo;s camp and one in Miki&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she says as
she draws near, &ldquo;but I should have started here, they probably think I&rsquo;m
deserting a sinking ship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao makes room for her to sit down. &ldquo;What did you think of the race?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think Miki took Emi by surprise. I&rsquo;m not saying she&rsquo;s become
complacent, but she&rsquo;s never lost before. I bet we&rsquo;ll see a different
side to Emi when she comes out for the hundred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao nods, &ldquo;do you two want any snacks or drinks from the stall? My
shout.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should know the answer to that by now,&rdquo; Suzu smirks.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Hisao has just got back to their seats, laden with gloriously unhealthy treats, when the girls&rsquo; hundred metres is announced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What kept you? I was worrying that you&rsquo;d miss the race,&rdquo; Suzu chides.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Long queue. I was ready to abandon the mission, but we got the prize.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The competitors walk out; Emi is grimly determined, Miki radiates
relaxed confidence. Once they take their mark both girls&rsquo; faces are a
mask of concentration. This time Hisao is excited rather than nervous.
</p>

<p>
The start sees Emi take a small lead, but it only lasts to the twenty
metre mark. Miki is moving so smoothly by this point that she appears to
be floating across the ground. There is no let up this time; she
maintains full intensity to the finish line, the rest of the field in
her wake.
</p>

<p>
Pumping her arms in triumph, she races over to her friends and gathers
them into a group hug, jumping up and down with them. &ldquo;Did you see? Did
you <i>see</i>?!&rdquo; Miki yells, laughing, tears streaming down her face. &ldquo;It
was <i>perfect</i>. From the b of the bang, Van-fucking-gelis playing in my
head, to the dip at the end. Perfect!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
None of them know whether to laugh or cry so they do both, celebrating
the <i>way</i> she ran as much as the result.
</p>

<p>
All too soon they are interrupted by the team captain. &ldquo;Well done Miki,
but we&rsquo;ve still got the relay to go. You can party as much as you want
after that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wiping her face, Miki shoots them a brilliant grin and says, &ldquo;hold this
mood, I&rsquo;ll be back before you know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Hisao looks puzzled when he sees Miki lining up to take the first leg of the relay. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they put the fastest runner last?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Molly nods, &ldquo;the captain is a clever fellow though. Look at the girl
lining up against her, she&rsquo;s quaking in her boots. They&rsquo;ve lost before
the gun goes off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu sniggers, &ldquo;seems she&rsquo;s misplaced the &lsquo;confidence&rsquo; and
&lsquo;determination&rsquo; from their dorky school motto!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Molly predicted, Miki establishes an emphatic lead in the first leg
which Ritsu and Keiko extend in turn. Emi is left with a victory lap,
which she takes with obvious pleasure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;ll be OK to congratulate Emi now,&rdquo; Molly says, &ldquo;are
you coming Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nodding, Suzu replies, &ldquo;Hisao&rsquo;s got <i>that look</i> on his face, I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;ll be safe to be around them for a while!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The medal ceremony seems to drag on forever but Hisao and Miki are finally reunited.  Walking away from the track, medals clinking around Miki&rsquo;s neck, they talk excitedly, reliving the races. As they draw near to the dorms Hisao sees something that stops him in his tracks. &ldquo;I thought Ikuno was dating Takashi?!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it looked like on Monday. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He points out Haruhiko, his own medal flashing in the sun and his arm
firmly around Ikuno&rsquo;s waist. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re headed to the boys&rsquo;
dorms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Huh. Do you think that&rsquo;s angry rebound sex or has she got herself a fan
club? Good for her either way, though she could have better taste in
boys.&rdquo; She puts on an exaggeratedly thoughtful look. &ldquo;Hmm, maybe <i>I</i>
should get into polynomials.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After racking his brain for a few seconds Hisao bursts into laughter. &ldquo;I
think you mean <i>polyamory</i>! No thanks, I don&rsquo;t play well with others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Spoilsport! Doesn&rsquo;t have to be another guy, I bet Misha&rsquo;d be up for a
bit of fun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eugh! I need the mind bleach!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing she says, &ldquo;come on, I need to shower and change before the
party.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Hisao is making polite conversation with members of the other school&rsquo;s track team when Miki grabs his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to be rude, but may I drag my boyfriend away?&rdquo;
At their nods she leads him to a quiet corner. &ldquo;I was talking to
Haruhiko about seeing him with Ikuno. He said that he wanted to
celebrate winning a medal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sounds familiar!&rdquo; Hisao says, remembering how they spent the hour
between leaving the medal ceremony and arriving at the party.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, yeah,&rdquo; she admits, &ldquo;but the thing is, he claims that they aren&rsquo;t
dating and said she&rsquo;s <i>anyone&rsquo;s</i> girlfriend. Then he went quiet and
walked off. I can&rsquo;t work out if he was being mean &lsquo;cos he wanted more
from the hook-up than she did, or if something else is going on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really any of our business,&rdquo; Hisao says uneasily, &ldquo;but that
does seem strange. Now that I think of it, we&rsquo;ve seen her with three
different guys in the space of a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> her dad with her in the city?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope it was, I&rsquo;m not sure what the alternative would be. I think we
should ask around on Monday, see if anyone else has noticed anything
odd. But let&rsquo;s leave it for now, you need to circulate and lord it over
the losers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you know I&rsquo;m a very humble winner!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, go and be <i>humble</i> in Emi&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
As soon as the lunch bell rings on Monday, Miki walks over to Natsume&rsquo;s desk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not our new queen of the track,&rdquo; Natsume&rsquo;s eyes flicker to
Hisao, who has come to stand next to Miki. &ldquo;And her faithful soigneur.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We should interview her for the next issue. Get the scoop on how she
managed to beat the fastest thing on no legs,&rdquo; Naomi says excitedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh yeah, an interview, great, but could we go somewhere quiet to spare
my blushes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume shoots her a knowing look and heaves herself to her feet. &ldquo;The
clubroom should be free, but you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me if I&rsquo;m a little
slower than you&rsquo;re used to.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Once they&rsquo;ve settled into the clubroom&rsquo;s comfortable couches Natsume opens by saying, &ldquo;Miki, in all the time I&rsquo;ve known you, you&rsquo;ve never <i>once</i> needed your blushes spared. What&rsquo;s this about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki smirks at Hisao. &ldquo;Told you she was the right person to talk to!
There&rsquo;s some things we find odd about Ikuno and it would be good to hear
what <i>you</i> think, maybe we&rsquo;re just imagining stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The quiet girl you sit next to? What could possibly be odd about
<i>her</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A week ago we&rsquo;d have said the same, but we&rsquo;ve seen her walk out of the
cafeteria holding hands with Takeshi, going to the boys&rsquo; dorms with
Haruhiko all over her, and in the city with an older man who may or may
not be her father,&rdquo; Hisao explains.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rin said she got a creepy vibe from the old guy, staring at her and
Molly. And when I talked to Haruhiko he said that he wasn&rsquo;t dating her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say that she was anyone&rsquo;s girlfriend?&rdquo; Seeing Miki nod he
continues, &ldquo;Shizune told me that she regularly comes back late from
visits to the city, supposedly dealing with family issues. She was
<i>very</i> indignant that the school administration lets Ikuno get away with
ignoring curfew.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you thinking what I&rsquo;m thinking Nat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Probably. Can you grab a copy of the article the Principal spiked?&rdquo;
Seeing Hisao and Miki share a confused look she explains, &ldquo;he stopped us
publishing it despite Mr Ishiguro giving us the go ahead. Apparently
it&rsquo;s not a fitting topic for a high class academy like Yamaku.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The article on the participation of Japanese schoolgirls in compensated
dating and the following discussion are a revelation to Hisao and Miki.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That bit about Yamaku girls being particularly vulnerable because
paraphiliacs can have other psychoses was extremely disturbing,&rdquo; Hisao
says, concern in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You better not be with me &lsquo;cos you&rsquo;re one of those cripple-lovers!&rdquo;
Miki stumps Hisao playfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love what&rsquo;s there, not what isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As Miki blushes, Naomi chirps, &ldquo;get a room you two!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I see why you were successful on Saturday,&rdquo; Natsume says, a
twinkle in her eyes. &ldquo;Emi thought she was racing Miki, but she was
actually up against <i>both</i> of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we could find Ikuno on one of the online notice boards you mentioned
in the article, we&rsquo;d have our suspicions confirmed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We tried to get on the boards when we were doing our research, but the
school blocks them,&rdquo; Naomi says crossly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I-I can s-show you how to use a p-proxy to bypass the s-security.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki and Hisao look around in surprise, noticing Hanako for the first
time. She is working quietly at a side table, typing up an article on a
laptop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meet the best undercover reporter the club&rsquo;s ever had!&rdquo; Naomi beams.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;N-not really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put yourself down girl, I&rsquo;m going to be a <i>lot</i> more careful
about what I say from now on in case you pop up from nowhere again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you learn to do this Hanako?&rdquo; Hisao asks, fascinated as she
runs through configuration screens.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A-at the orphanage when they b-blocked WoW. I couldn&rsquo;t l-let them get
between me and E-Elvira, undead warlock and Mistress of the D-dark!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Not really understanding what she is talking about, Hisao says, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
very impressive. Naomi, can you remember any of the sites?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you, we found out they existed but never got onto any of them.
Besides, I don&rsquo;t like using a computer for too long, might set me off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me,&rdquo; Natsume says holding up stiff hands, &ldquo;Hana&rsquo;s got the
best google-fu.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, you found her!&rdquo; Miki says excitedly, pounding Hanako on the back. &ldquo;Fantastic work!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;T-thanks,&rdquo; she squeaks, overcome by both the praise and the physical
contact.
</p>

<p>
They inspect the picture of Ikuno looking shy in her school uniform with
the tagline &rsquo;Can you love this katawa?&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s done her market research,&rdquo; Hisao mutters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The question is, what now?&rdquo; Natsume says thoughtfully. &ldquo;If we tell the
Administration they&rsquo;re likely to expel her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako gasps, &ldquo;oh, I w-wouldn&rsquo;t w-want her to g-get in t-trouble because
I f-found h-her p-p-profile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao snorts, &ldquo;Shizune might like that, but I doubt any of us would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Seeing them shake their heads, Natsume continues, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ve got to
choose between pretending we know nothing, or trying to do something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel right ignoring it. Thinking about her putting herself out
there for those sick fucks makes me want to throw up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao nods in agreement, &ldquo;if anything happens to her on one of these
&lsquo;dates&rsquo; and we hadn&rsquo;t tried <i>something</i>, I&rsquo;d be distraught.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what <i>can</i> we do? We don&rsquo;t have any leverage except for an empty
threat to tell the authorities, and I think she&rsquo;d see through that,&rdquo;
Naomi counters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M-maybe we should just t-talk to her, hear her s-side of the story.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Natsume nods, &ldquo;agreed. If we can learn a little more about what&rsquo;s going
on, maybe we&rsquo;ll get a clearer idea of where to go with this. I don&rsquo;t
think I should talk to her, my reputation for being a little&#x2026; sharp
might stop her opening up. Naomi of course, she can charm the pants off
anyone.&rdquo; Naomi&rsquo;s chuckle brings a hint of colour to Natsume&rsquo;s cheeks.
&ldquo;Hana?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shakes her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m s-seeing Misaki to go through her photos from
the track m-meet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I remember now. I think we&rsquo;ll go with Miki&rsquo;s straight talking
then, a boy might make her clam up,&rdquo; she nods an apology to Hisao.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some of the leaflets the lady from the BOND Project sent
through after we interviewed her, you can try giving her one. Now we
just need a reason to get her here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The &lsquo;can we interview you for an update to your yearbook profile?&rsquo;
routine never fails,&rdquo; Naomi giggles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I-t&rsquo;s an oldie b-but a goodie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with that. Right, classes will end for the day soon. Naomi,
pick Ikuno up from class and bring her here. Miki, wait here for them.
Go and have your meeting with Misaki, Hana. Hisao and I will wait in my
room; meet us there once you&rsquo;ve spoken to Ikuno.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Ikuno is surprised to see Miki when she follows Naomi into the clubroom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in the newspaper club, why are you here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve brought you here under false pretences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What else could you possibly want with <i>me</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about your dating site profile. We&rsquo;re worried about you and want
to offer you the chance to talk about it. Or if you don&rsquo;t want to talk
to us, we&rsquo;ve got details of an organisation that will listen,&rdquo; Naomi
holds out a leaflet to her.
</p>

<p>
A scared look flashes across Ikuno&rsquo;s face, but she launches into what is
obviously a well practised explanation. &ldquo;Oh, that. It&rsquo;s part of my
one-woman campaign to subvert Japan&rsquo;s patriarchal society.
Redistributing wealth from the reactionaries not only empowers me, but
also funds my propaganda. I should bring some of my pamphlets in, maybe
you&rsquo;d write an article to help me spread my ideas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki grows angry as she listens to Ikuno. &ldquo;Do you expect me to believe
that drivel? Are you <i>subverting the patriarchy</i> when some perverted old
man bends you over and does you like a dog? Are you <i>empowered</i> when
you&rsquo;re on your knees in front of an asshole like Takashi with his cock
in your mouth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ikuno is shocked into dropping her pretence. &ldquo;At least they notice me
when I&rsquo;m with them! I might as well be <i>invisible</i> given how little
attention people pay me the rest of the time. You sit next to me in
class, when did <i>you</i> last speak to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki is taken aback, &ldquo;well, you don-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky, you&rsquo;ve got Hisao. He doesn&rsquo;t care about being in your
shadow, all he wants is for you to be happy. I&rsquo;ve got <i>no-one</i> except
when I&rsquo;m on one of my dates. The rest of the time I&rsquo;m so lonely I wish I
was <i>dead</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This is too much for Naomi, who tries to take Ikuno into her arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she shouts, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t pretend to care just to make yourself feel
better!&rdquo; She turns towards the door, pausing to snatch the leaflet from
Naomi&rsquo;s hand. She looks back at them as she is about to leave; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you <i>dare</i> speak to me again, I&rsquo;ll report you to the Principal for
harassment if you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That could&rsquo;ve gone better,&rdquo; Naomi says unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I screwed up, I shouldn&rsquo;t have got angry and said that stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it would&rsquo;ve ended like that however we handled it. Come on, we
should report back.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>
Natsume sighs as the girls finish their account of the meeting. &ldquo;At least she took the leaflet, maybe she&rsquo;ll get in touch with someone from the BOND Project. She clearly doesn&rsquo;t want anything from us though, there&rsquo;s no point poking the bear any further.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a walk Hisao, I need to clear my head.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As soon as the door closes behind them Natsume asks, &ldquo;will you give me a
hug?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course! You hardly ever let me have cuddles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Settling into Naomi&rsquo;s embrace she starts to speak softly. &ldquo;I just had a
very disturbing thought. The Principal wouldn&rsquo;t let us publish that
article. The school won&rsquo;t punish Ikuno for ignoring curfew. She&rsquo;s
confident that the Principal will take her side in a dispute with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi goes pale. &ldquo;Oh <i>shit</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

</div>

<p>
Miki and Hisao walk in silence for a
while, letting the sunshine lighten their mood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So, &lsquo;love what&rsquo;s there&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Truly, madly, deeply. Problem?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her answer is a fierce hug that threatens to mash them into a single,
conjoined entity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hisao&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Surprised by her hesitant tone he disengages just far enough to see a
troubled expression on her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something Ikuno said is bothering me. After she stopped spouting
bollocks she said that I didn&rsquo;t know how lucky I was to have a man like
you. Thinking about it, you&rsquo;ve always got my back, you&rsquo;re always there
for me. I know what <i>I</i> get from us being together, but what about you?
Is it enough?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He takes her hand and kisses it, wanting a little time to think so he
doesn&rsquo;t misspeak. &ldquo;Do you remember when I walked into class on my first
day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao laughs, &ldquo;yeah, that sums it up nicely. I am going to answer you,
but will you tell me why you decided to get me running with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shrugs, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy. Emi was moaning on about you skipping
mornings, how lazy you were, how you didn&rsquo;t appreciate what she was
doing for you. I figured I could kill two birds with one stone: piss her
off by showing her that <i>she</i> was the problem, and have Mutou&rsquo;s new BFF
under my thumb so I could copy his homework. First one worked out just
fine but you never did let me copy, stingy bastard.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I did better than that, people want to copy <i>your</i> homework now! OK so
what changed, when did I go from forgettable to dateable?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hmm. Well you stopped being a scared little boy and you worked hard. I
could see how difficult running was for you to begin with, but you
didn&rsquo;t let that stop you. But I didn&rsquo;t realise how <i>much</i> you&rsquo;d changed
until I tweaked a hamstring and you offered to massage it. I was
expecting it to do fuck all good but I was curious to see if you were
brave enough to follow through; I bet you heard that I&rsquo;ve decked boys
for trying to get handsy with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nods.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you were brave enough and it did help. I was back to full training
<i>days</i> earlier than normal. And I&rsquo;m not gonna lie, once I realised you
weren&rsquo;t just trying to grope me, I <i>loved</i> the feel of your strong, warm
hands on my body. Then you said that&rsquo;d you&rsquo;d been learning about massage
because you&rsquo;d hoped to be able to help me&#x2026; Hisao, you don&rsquo;t know how
long its been since someone did anything for me without wanting
something in return.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>You</i> were the catalyst for those changes, seeing how you approach life
taught me to be brave again. I&rsquo;m not saying that I wouldn&rsquo;t have got
there on my own but it would have taken a <i>lot</i> longer. I&rsquo;m a better
version of me when I&rsquo;m with you, Hisao 2.0. Thanks to you I&rsquo;ve become
this fine specimen of manhood who can look after his woman.&rdquo; He strikes
a manly pose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no man&rsquo;s woman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know and that&rsquo;s just one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s so amazing to be
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cupping his face affectionately she says, &ldquo;We need to talk about this
compensated dating thing though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You get plenty of compensation. Awesome massages, world class science
tuition&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dunno Hisao, I feel like you&rsquo;re undervaluing all this,&rdquo; she gestures
at her toned body and walks off towards the cafeteria.
</p>

<p>
Shaking his head and chuckling he says, &ldquo;never change Miki Miura!&rdquo; and
falls into step with her, side by side, walking together.
