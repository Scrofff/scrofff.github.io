<p>
Miki hugs herself to keep in the warmth as she walks down to the track.
An hour after dawn, the temperature hovers just above freezing, and the
late winter sun makes the frost patches sparkle. She smiles as she sees
a handful of the Track Team training, and watches quietly for a while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pick those feet up Asahi! You&rsquo;re gonna be racing at a cross country
meet, not some namby-pamby track event!&rdquo; she yells as the group runs by.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d take advice from a <i>sprinter</i>,&rdquo; he replies with a grin and a
wave.
</p>

<p>
She sticks her tongue out in response and continues her tour of the part
of Yamaku she will miss the most. She smiles wickedly as she passes the
track shed. &rsquo;There&rsquo;s still time for us to leave our mark here, though I
kinda wish I&rsquo;d thought about it back in summer&#x2026;&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Coming around to the bleachers, she sees a trestle table set up with
insulated flasks and disposable cups, and a boy dressed in what looks
like <i>all</i> of his training kit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hi Yuuto. How long&rsquo;ve you been playing tea-boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you ever came to morning practice Miki, you&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve known we started
offering hot drinks when I took over as captain. I thought it might
tempt more people to show up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a good idea but getting students out at this time of day is a
hard sell at the best of times, let alone in the middle of winter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I bet a tonne of people would turn up if they thought <i>you</i> were gonna
be here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I highly doubt it, Emi&rsquo;s the popular one, all that peppy &lsquo;fastest thing
on no legs&rsquo; and cutesy twintails.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be surprised.&rdquo; He looks down and shuffles his feet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&#x2026;/we&rsquo;re/ going to miss you. It won&rsquo;t feel the same when you&rsquo;re
gone. I don&rsquo;t think you know how much people appreciate the banter, the
encouragement. I swear Yui grew two centimetres when you said her
sprinting form was first rate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, I got a lot out of being on the team too, it&rsquo;s gonna be hard to
leave you guys behind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the right time for you to move on though. You&rsquo;re the real deal
Miki, you need more challenging competition to stretch you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see. Maybe I won&rsquo;t be able to hack it in the real world. Maybe
I&rsquo;ll come running back with my tail between my legs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nah, Miki Miura runs from <i>nothing</i>!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She reaches out and ruffles his hair affectionately. &ldquo;Thanks man, I
appreciate the confidence. One thing&rsquo;s for sure, I&rsquo;m looking forward to
being invited back to present the prizes at the end of season meet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, let us know when you&rsquo;ve got your Olympic medal and we&rsquo;ll
think about it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a laugh she turns and sets of towards the main building, a grin on
her face and a spring in her stride.
</p>

<p>
Mutou looks up from his science journal to see Miki walking into the
classroom. &ldquo;You know seniors don&rsquo;t have classes, Miura?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do. And call me Miki, surnames are too stuffy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been declining that offer since we first met, what makes you think
I&rsquo;d change my mind now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s pretty much your last chance, live a little!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiles awkwardly. &ldquo;I believe I can resist the temptation. Do you need
something from me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not really, I&rsquo;m just&#x2026;restless. I&rsquo;m not used to having this much time
on my hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah yes, your satellites have managed to escape your gravitational well
for a while. It was a relief when you three found a mutually acceptable
centre of mass to orbit around, I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to dealing with
the big bang I thought was inevitable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have absolutely no clue what any of that means.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was referring to Suzuki and Nakai.&rdquo; Seeing the embarrassed expression
on her face, he continues, &ldquo;while it&rsquo;s part of a teacher&rsquo;s job to have a
general idea of their students&rsquo; relationships, that doesn&rsquo;t include
prying into things which are none of their business. However, I&rsquo;ve seen
how much you benefit from each others&rsquo; support and I hope it&rsquo;ll continue
past high school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well yeah, we&rsquo;re planning on ending up in the same place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mutou nods approvingly. &ldquo;Good. How will that work with your
sponsorship?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They said it doesn&rsquo;t matter where I train as long as it&rsquo;s with a
qualified coach, and the universities Suzu and Hisao are trying for have
strong athletics teams.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At first I wasn&rsquo;t sure about this ambassador rôle you&rsquo;re going into,
but the more I think about it, the more I realise it suits you. What
point would there be for you to struggle through a university course
you&rsquo;re not interested in, only to fall into a career you hate? This way
you can inspire others in your position and help educate the public.
Heaven knows this country&rsquo;s attitude towards the disabled needs shaking
up, we shouldn&rsquo;t need places like Yamaku for kids like you to be given a
fair chance at life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fiddles with the journal, avoiding looking at her. &ldquo;I hope you
realise that being in the public eye comes with many pitfalls. The
recent scandals involving those pop idols show how easily a career can
be torn down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m gonna be a runner not a singer. Which is a blessing, my
voice is nothing to write home about. And there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;d touch any
of the filthy drugs they were caught with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the case of the politician who was photographed leaving
his mistress&rsquo;s apartment when he was supposed to be on paternity leave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going on about? I&rsquo;m not even married, let alone a parent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to&#x2026;&rdquo; He sighs and looks up at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you
to be unprepared. You need to realise that <i>all</i> aspects of your life
will be under scrutiny if your athletics career takes off, you&rsquo;ll need
to make sure you at least appear to be abiding by society&rsquo;s norms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know wha-&rdquo; Miki splutters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just remember it&rsquo;s not only you who could be affected. Anyway, speaking
of scrutiny, it&rsquo;s high time I got on with this grading. I&rsquo;ll see you at
graduation, Miura.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Um, yeah, thanks I guess.&rdquo; With that, Miki leaves the classroom for the
last time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hello, Miki, I thought I&rsquo;d be seeing you sooner rather than later,&rdquo;
Nurse says as she walks into his office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really? What are you, some sort of mind reader?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When Hisao picked up his prescriptions early because he was going away
for a few days, closely followed by Suzu asking for something to help
her concentrate in some upcoming entrance exams, I put two and two
together and realised you&rsquo;d be bored without your&#x2026;support mechanisms.
And you only ever come to see me when you&rsquo;re bored.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki cannot help laughing at the exaggeratedly glum expression on his
face before scowling and saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it when you give her that
shit, it can&rsquo;t be good for her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your concern for your friend is commendable, but I&rsquo;d appreciate it if
you treated me as a member of staff. Don&rsquo;t presume too much on our long
acquaintanceship.&rdquo; When she nods apologetically, he continues, &ldquo;the
studies haven&rsquo;t found long-term issues with anything I might
hypothetically prescribe for a narcoleptic. Keep being suspicious of
drugs though, there are many temptations in the world you&rsquo;re about to
set foot into.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> end up like Marion fu- um, flipping Jones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good. You know, I&rsquo;ve felt more than a little guilty about prioritising
Emi over you since we arrived, but you&rsquo;ve hardly needed any support. You
adapted pretty quickly to life here, as long as we don&rsquo;t mention the
shaky start,&rdquo; he adds with a cheeky grin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s <i>years</i> since I got into a fight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank goodness. You can ill afford to have that hand out of action. But
as I said, we won&rsquo;t mention that. Let&rsquo;s focus on the positives, like how
well you&rsquo;ve managed to rebuild your life, like how you&rsquo;ve found
something to run <i>towards</i>. Thanks in no small part to Suzu!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve kicked up a fuss about baby-sitting her if you hadn&rsquo;t already
brain-washed me into doing whatever you told me to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t question the wisdom of your elders. My plans never fail!
Well, almost never. I didn&rsquo;t anticipate how things would turn out with
Hisao&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughs when Miki&rsquo;s stomach growls loudly. &ldquo;I bet you forgot breakfast
without anyone to nag you. Go and get some lunch, I don&rsquo;t want to have
to scrape you off the track because you fainted from hunger while
training! In case I don&rsquo;t see you again before graduation, I&rsquo;d like to
say it&rsquo;s been an honour working with you Ms. Miura, and I look forward
to watching you compete on the world stage. Now stop bothering me and
let me get on with my work!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Grinning at the stunned expression on her face, he ushers her out of his
office and gently closes the door.
</p>

<p>
Miki walks into the cafeteria and joins the queue, scanning the day&rsquo;s
offerings. &rsquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss the free food, even if it <i>is</i> bland as
hell!&rsquo; she thinks, depositing a bowl of ramen and a bottle of Pocari
sweat on a tray which she lifts carefully and steadies on her stump.
Looking around for a seat, she spots a shock of blonde hair and makes
her way to where Naomi is sitting. &ldquo;Fancy some company?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hi Miki, that&rsquo;d be lovely. It&rsquo;s pretty quiet now most of the seniors
aren&rsquo;t around. How come you&rsquo;re on your own? We don&rsquo;t often see you
without Suzu or Hisao in tow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could say the same about you and Natsume. They&rsquo;re away doing entrance
exams, they figured out they could take in three different campuses on
consecutive days, so they went on a tour. Madness, if you ask me, but at
least they&rsquo;re due home later this afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi shudders. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine putting myself through something like
that! It&rsquo;s tiring enough taking one exam, and when you factor in the
travel&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Natsume off doing exams too?&rdquo; Miki is surprised to see Naomi&rsquo;s eyes
suddenly glisten with unshed tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve hardly seen her since we finished classes and
handed over the Newspaper Club to the juniors. It feels like she&rsquo;s
avoiding me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the hell? You two have been practically inseperable since first
year. Did you fight or something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Naomi shakes her head, tears starting to leak from the corner of her
eyes. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t think of anything I might have done to offend her.
I&rsquo;m scared Miki. What if she&rsquo;s decided she&rsquo;s outgrown me and is planning
on going it alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nah, I can&rsquo;t believe that, I&rsquo;ve seen the way she looks at you. It must
be some sort of misunderstanding. Maybe she thinks you&rsquo;re gonna leave
her behind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I&rsquo;d never do anything like that! I&rsquo;m at my wits&rsquo; end, what am I
supposed to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki takes Naomi&rsquo;s hand reassuringly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gotta find her and talk it
out. You&rsquo;ll kick yourself if you let it slide and never see her again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; Naomi stands up decisively and wipes her eyes. &ldquo;Thank
you. I wish I&rsquo;d talked to you earlier, I should&rsquo;ve known someone in your
position would give good relationship advice!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; Miki mutters under her breath as Naomi rushes out of the
cafeteria. &ldquo;Does <i>everyone</i> know our business? At least she&rsquo;s got enough
sense not to shoot her mouth off about it.&rdquo; Finishing her lunch, she
stretches and decides to have a nap before training.
</p>

Miki comes around the bend of her final warm down lap and sees a
familiar pair of spectators sitting in the bleachers. With a whoop of
joy she shifts into top gear and sprints towards them, impatient to be
reunited. Gathering them into a tight hug she says, &ldquo;welcome home, how
were the exams?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ewww, Miki, you&rsquo;re gross! But I&rsquo;ll allow it &lsquo;cos it&rsquo;s your birthday. I
think it&rsquo;s fair to say we&rsquo;re cautiously optimistic, right Hisao?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pulls them closer and nods. &ldquo;Missed you <i>so</i> much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, I find that hard to believe when you&rsquo;ve had this saucy minx
all to yourself for the past few days!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To be honest, we&rsquo;ve been too stressed and tired to do more than
cuddle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;s sake you two, I know what <i>I&rsquo;d</i> get up to if I had the chance to
stay in a room with a big bed and soundproof walls!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He disengages from the hug and offers Miki a bag of souvenirs they had
picked up on their travels. &ldquo;Happy birthday!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aww guys, you didn&rsquo;t have to get me anything. Having you back is the
best present I could&rsquo;ve wished for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, so you don&rsquo;t want <i>this</i> then?&rdquo; Suzu giggles, waving an ornate
envelope.
</p>

<p>
Miki grabs it and fumbles it open, an intrigued look on her face. When
she sees what it contains she gasps. &ldquo;The Imperial Suite at the Westin
Hotel? Suzu, are you mad? This must&rsquo;ve cost a fortu-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu stands on tiptoes and kisses her soundly, cutting off her protests.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worth every Yen. Being away from you was torture for both of us.
Don&rsquo;t you want to <i>show</i> us what you&rsquo;d get up to in a room with a big
bed and soundproof walls?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki&rsquo;s grin is almost broad enough to split her face in half. &ldquo;Hell
yeah, you have no idea what I&rsquo;ve been dreaming up while you were away.
Come on, we&rsquo;re heading into town as soon as I&rsquo;ve showered and changed.
I&rsquo;m not gonna waste a <i>second</i> of this!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think of it as a taste of things to come. When we leave school we&rsquo;ll be
able to get a little apartment together. Imagine having a place where we
can be ourselves, where we won&rsquo;t have to hide!&rdquo; There is no mistaking
the excitement in Suzu&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe this growing up and moving on business isn&rsquo;t so bad after all!&rdquo;
With that said, Miki leads them away from the track, towards their
future.
