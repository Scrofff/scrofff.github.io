<div id="content">
<h1 class="title">&ldquo;You are not alone&#x2026;&rdquo;</h1>
<p>
Miki and Hisao sit leaning against each other, arms entwined, Suzu
draped across their laps. Miki absentmindedly plays with Suzu&rsquo;s hair, a
tender expression on her face as she ignores whatever mindless reality
show is currently on the television in the common room. Hisao is
entranced by the sight of Miki in repose, a sharp contrast to her usual
restless energy. Without warning Suzu jerks awake and cries, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
alone!&rdquo; and starts to sob.
</p>

<p>
Suzu&rsquo;s habit of waking suddenly and bringing her dreams with her still
unnerves Hisao, as does the way she does not distinguish greatly between
waking and sleeping experiences. Miki, who has learnt to take Suzu&rsquo;s
peculiarities in her stride, leans over to kiss her before asking,
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s alone? And what&rsquo;s so sad about it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hanako! Who does she have now that Lilly&rsquo;s gone? It&rsquo;s not like first
year, she&rsquo;s got used to her little family and it&rsquo;s been ripped away from
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki gently wipes the tears from Suzu&rsquo;s face and makes gentle shushing
noises while Hisao rubs her feet in an attempt to help calm her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No-one deserves that and I bet no-one will even notice her falling back
into her old ways. If we don&rsquo;t do something we&rsquo;ll wake up one morning to
her being carried out in a body bag!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that what you saw? Is that what woke you?&rdquo; Hisao asks in what he
hopes is a soothing tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes! No&#x2026; She was alone in her room, suffocated by the black thoughts
that were pouring out of her. So dark, no hope. No-one deserves that,&rdquo;
she repeats. &ldquo;Hisao, you need to work out how we&rsquo;re going to keep her
from drowning in her isolation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Demands to <i>do something</i> are another of Suzu&rsquo;s quirks that he is still
getting used to. She will bring some crazy, impossible, idea from her
dreams and expect him to make it real. And yet, none of her demands have
proved to be impossible so far. Suzu&rsquo;s absolute confidence combined with
Miki&rsquo;s drive and energy have motivated him to try things he never would
have attempted before. It is exhausting, nerve-wracking, <i>exhilarating</i>;
he has never felt more alive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, you looking to expand your harem? We&rsquo;re not enough for you?&rdquo; Miki
teases, keen to lighten the mood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What? No! It&rsquo;s not like that.&rdquo; A blush spreads across Suzu&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;You
know what they always say at the start of year assembly. Well she <i>is</i>
alone and it is up to us to be the better person. People.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You better not go to her with pity in your heart or any shit like that.
People like us, we see it a mile off and don&rsquo;t take kindly to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where does concern end and pity begin?&rdquo; Suzu asks rhetorically. &ldquo; I
can&rsquo;t unsee what I saw and I won&rsquo;t ignore it either. They&rsquo;ve said a
million times that it&rsquo;s a hard world for &lsquo;people like us&rsquo;, that we
should look out for each other. I just want to put that into practice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bridge between Hanako and us?&rdquo; Hisao asks. &ldquo;How do we get
her to&#x2026;engage? If we could find some common ground I think we&rsquo;d be
able to get her to open up to us with some perseverance and patience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You nerds always have your head in a book, that&rsquo;s got to count for
something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao kisses Miki enthusiastically. &ldquo;Yes! Did you submit your review of
<i>Life of Pi</i> to the newspaper yet, Suzu? That was the book she was
reading when I first arrived, you could ask her for some feedback on
what you&rsquo;ve written. And I saw her with <i>Lord of the Flies</i> the other
day, I spotted something when I read it in the hospital, I could run
that by her.&rdquo; He thinks for a while, rubbing Suzu&rsquo;s foot with one hand
and stroking Miki&rsquo;s hair with the other. &ldquo;Food! Miki, you like to eat
and she likes to cook!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah but her stuff can be a bit out there, I remember being in the
kitchen when one of her experiments went wrong&#x2026; Besides she&rsquo;s into
boring stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean <i>healthy</i> food, not pizza or burgers?&rdquo; Suzu giggles. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
low-key fashionable when she wants to be, maybe you could ask her for
some tips for something other than jeans and a tank top?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dude! That&rsquo;s my signature look and I&rsquo;m not about to change it!&rdquo; She
thinks for a while. &ldquo;I suppose I could try to get her to go shopping
with me, she&rsquo;ll probably understand my take on clothes better than some
people.&rdquo; She shoots Suzu a meaningful look. &ldquo;Anyway it&rsquo;s getting late,
we can&rsquo;t do anything right now and Suzu here is in need of some
comforting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t feel so bad, we&rsquo;ve got a pla-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush you. Hisao&rsquo;s looking a bit shell shocked, I bet he&rsquo;s in need of
some comfort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umm, not really&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For fuck&rsquo;s sake, do I have to spell it out? Fine. Let&rsquo;s go to bed, for
some unknown reason I want to have sex with you dumbasses.&rdquo;
</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
&ldquo;Hanako?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looks up from her book to see Suzu slumped over at her desk, head
resting on one arm while she lazily waves a sheet of paper. &ldquo;Natsume
nagged me into writing a review of <i>Life of Pi</i> for the newspaper, could
you take a look at it before I give it to her? I&rsquo;d be interested in your
opinion on it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;S-sure.&rdquo; She walks over and carefully takes the review. Suzu lets her
arm drop to the desk with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Umm, are you o-ok?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes. Sort of. Mostly. My insomnia kept me awake last night so I
ended up here early, but now the sleepies have kicked in and I&rsquo;m not
gonna make it through the morning. If I haven&rsquo;t moved by lunchtime, call
in the cavalry!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a quiet giggle, Hanako goes back to her desk, grabs her green pen
and starts reading Suzu&rsquo;s review.
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<p>
&ldquo;Did you spot the huge mistake Golding made?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako looks up in surprise to see Hisao smiling at her from an adjacent
beanbag. &ldquo;P-pardon me?&rdquo; she replies nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The mistake! Piggy&rsquo;s glasses!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;W-what about his glasses?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was <i>short-sighted</i>!&rdquo; Seeing that she did not realise the
significance of this he adds, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t start a fire with glasses that
correct short sight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! T-that would change so much! It would remove several points of
conflict a-and that big confrontation near the end. They probably
wouldn&rsquo;t even have been r-rescued if they hadn&rsquo;t set fire to the
forest.&rdquo; She shudders suddenly. &ldquo;I h-hated that bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder why he made such a basic error? It made me doubt the rest of
the story, since he got that wrong maybe he got the boys&rsquo; descent into
savagery wrong too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I found that v-very convincing, kids can be n-nasty even under
normal conditions,&rdquo; she replies sadly. &ldquo;But I think it probably doesn&rsquo;t
matter that he made a mistake. Piggy had to w-wear glasses to establish
him i-in the outgroup and I interpreted his s-short sight as symbolising
the blindness of pure intellectualism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao sits up in surprise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right! I didn&rsquo;t think of that, I was
so fixated on the science being wrong that I didn&rsquo;t go any deeper. Jeez
Hanako, how come we haven&rsquo;t talked books before? What are you reading
next? Maybe I could read it too and discuss it with you when we&rsquo;ve
finished.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I-I think I&rsquo;d like that. I&rsquo;m on a f-first novel kick at the moment and
there&rsquo;s a b-book called <i>The Wasp Factory</i> that sounds very
i-interesting&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
Hanako pushes open the kitchen door and sees Miki staring at the
microwave oven with a predatory expression on her face. She hesitates
for a moment but decides to go in anyway. She agreed with her therapist
to do her best to reach out to people after Lilly left and her recent
interactions with Suzu and Hisao have bolstered her confidence a little.
She finds Miki&rsquo;s boisterous nature intimidating, but the way she has
supported Suzu over the years makes her think that she has a kind heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;H-hi M-Miki,&rdquo; she says, disappointed that her voice has betrayed how
nervous she is feeling.
</p>

<p>
Miki spins round quickly and puts on a welcoming smile when she sees
Hanako flinch. &ldquo;Oh hi Hanako. Wow, don&rsquo;t you look cute today?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;W-what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That outfit! It really suits you.&rdquo; She pauses and Hanako is surprised
to see a hint of embarrassment appear on her face. &ldquo;Listen, do you think
you could help me out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;M-me? Umm well yes, if I c-can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking about getting some new clothes but I really can&rsquo;t go
shopping with Suzu, she throws money around like it&rsquo;s nothing. I don&rsquo;t
mean to be rude but I figured that you&rsquo;d understand what it&rsquo;s like to be
on a tight budget.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O-oh yes, I do. I felt the same about s-shopping with Lilly, but going
with another bargain h-hunter might be fun.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great! Come on then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;N-now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You got anything better to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako thinks for a moment then smiles and shakes her head. &ldquo;What about
t-that?&rdquo; she asks, pointing at the oven.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pffff,&rdquo; Miki replies with a dismissive wave. &ldquo;Microwave pizza probably
isn&rsquo;t the best breakfast. We can get ice cream in the city.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miki! You r-really need to be eating properly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whatever <i>mom</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I b-bet you&rsquo;d be even f-faster if you improved your diet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really? Hmm. Maybe I should enlist you as my dietician as well as my
fashion guru&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

</div>


<p>
&ldquo;Hi you, did you have fun with Hanako? I don&rsquo;t see any shopping bags,
what have you been doing all day?&rdquo; Suzu asks when Miki lets herself into
Hisao&rsquo;s room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Actually we had a great time. Shopping kinda got abandoned when we saw
that the university&rsquo;s cinema club were running an all-day Arjuna
marathon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You spent the whole day watching magical girl anime with Hanako?&rdquo; Hisao
asks incredulously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arjuna isn&rsquo;t a magical girl anime, it&rsquo;s a modern day re-interpretation
of an ancient saga! It&rsquo;s badass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure it wasn&rsquo;t just an excuse for you and Hanako to ogle cute
anime girls? I didn&rsquo;t know she swings that way,&rdquo; Suzu giggles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure she knows which way she swings&#x2026; She&rsquo;s such a sweetheart
though, I hope someone sees how beautiful she is, inside and out, and
does right by her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao pulls her into a hug. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s found her way into that big heart of
yours eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah. What is it with me and waifs and strays?&rdquo; She returns Hisao&rsquo;s hug
and buries her head into his chest. &ldquo;You guys better get used to her
being around. She&rsquo;s gonna look into high-performance diets for me and
we&rsquo;ve got a manga evening planned.&rdquo; She glares at a sniggering Suzu.
&ldquo;Manga is literature too! I&rsquo;m just saying that I&rsquo;m not dropping her when
we think her issues are sorted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that dropping her wasn&rsquo;t part of the plan. We&rsquo;ve got
some books we&rsquo;re going to read and discuss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to write some reviews together.&rdquo; Suzu adds. &ldquo;She came
with me to hand in our review of <i>Life of Pi</i> and seemed pretty
interested in what they were doing in the Newspaper Club. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised if she ended up ditching me in favour of them!&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;Getting closer to her does bring up an interesting question though. Do
we tell her about us?&rdquo; Hisao asks. &ldquo;We could hardly call her a friend
and then keep it from her, but I really don&rsquo;t know how she&rsquo;d react.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well <i>I</i> want to tell her. It&rsquo;s OK for you two, everyone knows you&rsquo;re
dating. But that leaves me feeling like the other woman, sneaking around
and seeing her lovers in secret. I&rsquo;m damn proud of what we&rsquo;ve made
together, of how far we&rsquo;ve come, and I&rsquo;m literally going to <i>burst</i> if I
don&rsquo;t tell someone soon!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki and Hisao move to the bed and sit on either side of her. &ldquo;I know
it&rsquo;s rough on you babe and I want to shout it from the rooftops too. But
at least you&rsquo;ve got a support group, telling her too soon could scare
her away from us, send her back to that room with her dark thoughts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu sighs and rests her head on Miki&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;When did you get so
smart? We will tell her when we think she can handle it, right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki kisses her forehead. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been this smart, you just didn&rsquo;t
notice. We shouldn&rsquo;t wait too long, I think she&rsquo;d appreciate us putting
our trust in her. And going by the way she was so set on improving my
diet, I get the feeling that she wants to prove she can be a friend to
be relied on. Convincing her that we see her that way would-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She is interrupted by a quiet knock on Hisao&rsquo;s door. They share a look
before Hisao goes to open it, revealing a nervously smiling Hanako
holding a book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I b-bought my own copy of this today s-so you can have the
l-library&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very thoughtful of you Hanako, the way you described it made me
want to start reading right away! Do you want to come in? Miki&rsquo;s here
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh I d-don&rsquo;t want to intrude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Contrary to popular belief, I <i>can</i> keep my hand to myself. For a
little while anyway,&rdquo; Miki laughs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hiya, Miki said you had fun watching anime instead of shopping today,&rdquo;
Suzu says as Hanako sits on the chair by the desk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Y-yes, I loved that show when I was little and it was interesting to
watch it again, now that I&rsquo;ve read the s-saga it was based on. I thought
they did a g-good job of bringing the story up to date and the
environmental i-issues it tackles are very topical.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See? Told you it wasn&rsquo;t just cute anime girls!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew that Hanako would be paying attention to the plot, doesn&rsquo;t mean
that <i>you</i> were!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, just cos you can never stay awake to the end of an episode,
doesn&rsquo;t mean that the rest of us can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao sees a wistful look on Hanako&rsquo;s face as she watches the girls
squabbling playfully. &ldquo;Are you alright Hanako?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, y-yes. It&rsquo;s just that you&rsquo;re all such good friends. W-why are you
even bothering with me? It&rsquo;s not like you n-need anyone else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, spending time with you is no bother! Did I look like I was forcing
myself to have fun today?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about whether we <i>need</i> other people,&rdquo; Suzu adds. &ldquo;Friendship
is like love: the more you have, the greater your capacity to express it
becomes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you must have all a-agreed to start talking to me, made some sort
of p-plan. Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao clears his throat in embarrassment. &ldquo;Suzu had a dream.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t ignore her dreams, not after that one time&#x2026;&rdquo; Miki says with
a shudder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Umm w-what sort of dream?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu rushes over to hug Hanako, whose eyes go wide in surprise. &ldquo;It was
horrible, you were so alone. I was scared for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Scared for me or s-sorry for me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Scared!&rdquo; they chorus.
</p>

<p>
Hanako hesitantly brings her arms up to return the hug. &ldquo;A-and now?&rdquo; She
is surprised to see unshed tears when Suzu leans back a little, but
cannot help smiling back at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m sad that I waited this long to get to know you. Think of all
the fun we&rsquo;ve missed out on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to make up for lost t-time then,&rdquo; she replies with a
giggle. &ldquo;Have you played D&amp;D? I&rsquo;ve been working on a c-campaign for
<i>years</i> and I&rsquo;d love to guide you t-through it&#x2026;&rdquo;
