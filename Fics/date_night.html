Hisao frowns when an unfamiliar noise interrupts his attempts to make
sense of his history assignment. A few moments later it repeats and he
recognises it as the notification tone from the group messaging app Suzu
had persuaded him to install. He grabs his phone and checks the
messages.

<p>
Suzu slips her arm through Hisao&rsquo;s as she collects him from Yamaku&rsquo;s
front gate and they set off down the hill, the setting sun lengthening
their shadows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s got into her this time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu shrugs. &ldquo;Who knows? If it was really serious she would&rsquo;ve given us
a bit more to go on. She&rsquo;s not one to drag us out for nothing though,
I&rsquo;m sure she thinks we need to do something about whatever bee she&rsquo;s got
in her bonnet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being kept in the dark. How am I supposed to figure out
what to do when I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he frets.
</p>

<p>
She rests her head on his shoulder. &ldquo;We might not have to <i>do</i> anything,
sometimes you just need to <i>be</i>. You&rsquo;ll give yourself an ulcer if you
insist on trying to fix everything. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, I know, you&rsquo;ve told me a million times and I&rsquo;m doing my best
to take it to heart. But it&rsquo;s not always easy, &lsquo;specially when it&rsquo;s
something to do with you two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out soon enough. And stop galloping, I haven&rsquo;t got giraffe
legs!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s she got to?&rdquo; Hisao asks as a tinkling bell announces their
arrival at the Shanghai. Looking around he sees a couple wearing Yamaku
uniforms chatting animatedly at a table by the window and, tucked away
in a quiet corner, a figure bundled up in a black sweatshirt, face
obscured by sunglasses and hood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oooh, is that-&rdquo; Suzu is interrupted by a hiss from the shrouded figure
who takes off her sunglasses revealing a scowling Miki. She beckons them
over, making a shushing gesture with her stump.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you playing at Miki?&rdquo; Suzu asks with a giggle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m safeguarding the virtue of our dear friend Hanako!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it in danger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes! What do you think about <i>that</i>?&rdquo; Miki asks, her outrage obvious as
she gestures towards Hanako and the mysterious student she is sitting
with.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phwoar, he&rsquo;s gorgeous! Where&rsquo;s he been all my life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not helping Suzu! All I know about him is he&rsquo;s in class 3-2, how
can we be sure he&rsquo;s not just after one thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven forbid! You&rsquo;ve <i>never</i> pursued someone with just one thing on
your mind&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, yeah, but that&rsquo;s different. I can look after myself, Hanako&rsquo;s a
newbie at this dating stuff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Breaking his silence, Hisao sighs. &ldquo;Look Miki, sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to
trust that your friends know what they&rsquo;re doing and let them get on with
their lives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miki and Suzu share an astonished glance. &ldquo;Who are you and what have you
done with the real Hisao?&rdquo; Suzu demands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah yeah, very funny, at least it proves I&rsquo;ve been listening! You
should practice what you preach.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, but it&rsquo;s-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go and talk to them.&rdquo; Before he can move Miki grabs his
arm and shakes her head vigorously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t butt in on their date!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the done thing. Back me up here, Suzu. Suzu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They look around to see her standing at Hanako&rsquo;s table, batting her
eyelashes at the mystery man. &ldquo;Hi Hanako, fancy meeting you here. Who&rsquo;s
your friend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh h-hello Suzu, I d-didn&rsquo;t notice you come in. This is Tochigiyama
Moriya.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, call me Tochi. I&rsquo;ll never forgive my parents for saddling me
with such a mouthful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sumo fans are they?&rdquo; Miki asks as she takes her place next to Suzu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much so. I fear I was a terrible disappointment to them when they
discovered I couldn&rsquo;t see beyond the end of my nose. Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;S-sorry Tochi, these are my friends Suzu Suzuki, Miki Miura and Hisao
Nakai.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of your achievements Ms Miura, congratulations on shaking up
the established order.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just call me Miki, surnames are too stuffy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So how did you two meet?&rdquo; Suzu asks eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hearing Miss Satou speak so affectionately about Hanako made me wonder
whether such an angel truly lived amongst us, though satisfying my
curiosity was difficult given her elusive nature. I&rsquo;m ashamed to say I
took advantage of the hubbub surrounding our beloved class
representative&rsquo;s departure to press my contact details into her hand and
exhort her to meet with me lest I wither in despair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aww, how sweet,&rdquo; Suzu coos, backhanding Miki as she mimes sticking her
fingers down her throat and gagging.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Contacting him was a bold move, Hanako,&rdquo; Hisao says approvingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dithered for a-ages until one day I asked myself what Miki would do,
then g-grabbed my phone and called him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao smiles fondly and nods. &ldquo;Yeah, she&rsquo;s an inspiration for sure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must say I had almost given up hope. You can only imagine my elation
when my prayers were answered and I heard her sweet voice on the line.
Oh, but where are my manners?&rdquo; Tochi asks rhetorically. &ldquo;Please, join us
for tea and cake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu grabs Miki&rsquo;s arm and starts nudging Hisao towards the exit. &ldquo;No,
no, we shouldn&rsquo;t keep you lovebirds any longer. Don&rsquo;t stay out too long
Hanako, we&rsquo;ve got classes tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Y-yes <i>mom</i>!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="org-center">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="../../css/line-flourish.png" alt="line-flourish.png" width="250" />
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Miki declares as she stomps up the hill to Yamaku.
&ldquo;All that flowery lingo. And you heard him say he took advantage of
Hanako!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well yeah but not in <i>that</i> way,&rdquo; Hisao protests. &ldquo;He seems fairly&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&#x2026;harmless.&rdquo; Suzu frowns as she remembers where one of the phrases
Tochi used came from. &ldquo;Tennyson! I knew I&rsquo;d come across that &lsquo;lest I
wither in despair&rsquo; line before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See! He&rsquo;s a plagiarist, you can&rsquo;t trust a plagiarist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suzu darts ahead of Miki and stands in her way, stopping her from
walking past. Taking her face in both hands, Suzu rises up on her
tiptoes and kisses her tenderly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> grateful for your protective
instincts and I look forward to benefiting from them for many years to
come. In return I provide things which you benefit from too, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
When Miki nods she continues, &ldquo;if we didn&rsquo;t have this give and take
you&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve dumped me ages ago for taking advantage of you. Tell me if I&rsquo;m
wrong, but I don&rsquo;t see the same dynamic between you and Hanako. You need
to be careful you&rsquo;re not treating her like Lilly did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No fucking way! I give her support and encouragement without standing
over her and telling her what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;True, but what does she give you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anythin-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about what <i>you</i> need. <i>She</i> needs to believe she&rsquo;s got
something to offer, otherwise she won&rsquo;t feel like an equal partner in
the friendship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A troubled look crosses Miki&rsquo;s face and she pulls back from Suzu, turns
and takes a few steps away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like she treats me as her big
sister. And I don&rsquo;t even get to see her that often these days, so much
for catching up on lost time&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Graduation&rsquo;s coming up fast, you need to prepare yourself to part ways
with her. The best thing you can do until then is let her make her own
decisions, her own mistakes, and offer her a shoulder to cry on if she
needs it. She&rsquo;s got her own path to follow and you won&rsquo;t be there to
pick her up if she falls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fuck you. And fuck you too Hisao.&rdquo; She wipes her eyes and blurts out,
&ldquo;why do things have to change? For the first time since I don&rsquo;t know
when, everything makes sense, everything just <i>works</i>. Why can&rsquo;t I have
some time to enjoy the life we&rsquo;ve struggled so damn hard to carve out
for ourselves? Every time I try to kick back I get reminded it&rsquo;s about
to end and I&rsquo;ll have to start again from <i>nothing</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not from nothing.&rdquo; Hisao walks over to Miki and hugs her from behind.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right there with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you? You two have plans, you know what you&rsquo;re gonna do, what
you&rsquo;re gonna <i>be</i>. Me? Not so much. How long are you gonna put up with
me mooching off you if I end up a neet?&rdquo; When Hisao starts to chuckle
she spins around to face him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you laugh at me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then stop saying stupid things. You a neet? I don&rsquo;t think so. We all
know what you should do, the opportunity is right there, waiting for you
to grab it with bo- with all your heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What if I can&rsquo;t make it? Right now I&rsquo;m a big fish in a small pond, out
there I&rsquo;ll be swimming with the sharks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hisao shrugs. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be perfect, just be the best version of
yourself you can be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dunno Hisao, no-one loves a loser.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter where you place, you&rsquo;re always a winner in my eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh fuck off, you glib bastard.&rdquo; In contrast to her words, Miki melts
into his arms and kisses him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> proud of you two right now, I can&rsquo;t even say,&rdquo; Suzu beams.
&ldquo;All this emotional stuff has made me hungry, how about I treat us to-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pizza!&rdquo; chorus Miki and Hisao.
</p>

<p>
Miki opens her door and is almost bowled over by a sobbing Hanako
falling into her arms. &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We broke up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What? How? If he did anything&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No no, <i>I</i> finished with <i>him</i>. I t-tried but I couldn&rsquo;t take it any
longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Awww, sit down and tell me all about it.&rdquo; Miki ushers her into the room
and passes her a box of tissues. When she shows no sign of speaking Miki
nudges her. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon then, spill the beans, what happened? You looked
disgustingly head-over-heels in the Shanghai last week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a b-bad girlfriend,&rdquo; she wails. &ldquo;I should n-never have accepted his
confession.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I find that <i>very</i> hard to believe. You&rsquo;re not just super cute, you&rsquo;re
kind and funny and clever. How the hell do you figure you&rsquo;re a bad
girlfriend?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to be t-tolerant of my boyfriend&rsquo;s little oddities b-but
it was just too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What type of oddities are we talking about?&rdquo; Miki asks suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The p-p-poetry! He&rsquo;d spend hours reading aloud this <i>excruciating</i>
poetry he&rsquo;d written and I was s-supposed to sit in appreciative silence
until he f-finished, then tell him how good it was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I bet it didn&rsquo;t even rhyme! He came across as the sort of pretentious
git who&rsquo;d look down on conventional stuff like that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hanako giggles. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, h-he calls it &lsquo;free verse&rsquo;.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As kinks go poetry is pretty harmless. Not that I&rsquo;m not saying you
should put up with it,&rdquo; she clarifies hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded something a bit m-more <i>physical</i>, a girl&rsquo;s got
n-needs after all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hanako!&rdquo; Miki shakes her head and laughs. &ldquo;Hang on a tick while I grab
us something from my emergency ice cream stash. When I get back I&rsquo;ll
tell you a tale about the first guy I dated and his <i>oddities</i>&#x2026;&rdquo;
