<h1 class="title">Lullaby</h1>
<p>
We&rsquo;re sitting in the common room on another tedious Saturday afternoon.
We should be making the most of the mid-September weather before we&rsquo;re
confined to barracks for the winter but no, this bunch of
stick-in-the-muds wants to hang around inside. The teachers have eased
up on supervising us now we&rsquo;re in our second term and the senior class
reps who&rsquo;re supposed to keep us in line while we&rsquo;re in the dorms are
busy with school work, chores, or fucking if the noises coming from
Yuna&rsquo;s room are anything to go by. So we&rsquo;ve been left to our own devices
and I gotta say, boredom is setting in. There&rsquo;s nothing good on telly,
one of the girls who thinks she&rsquo;s cool has commandeered the remote and
is making us watch prehistoric music videos. I remember my dad listening
to this a lot when I was a kid, before he&#x2026;nah don&rsquo;t dwell on that,
he&rsquo;s not worth the effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Noooo, turn it off, turn it OFF!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s got into Suzu? Shit, she&rsquo;s bluescreened. &ldquo;Coming through, shift
your arses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, don&rsquo;t get between her and her <i>girlfriend</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stuck up bitch! &ldquo;Now now, no need to be jealous, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find
someone one day. Oh wait, I forgot, you&rsquo;ve already tried it on with half
the boys in the school. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get lucky before you&rsquo;ve gone
through the other half.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You cow, I ought to-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave it Ritsu, you know she&rsquo;ll hurt you if you try anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
You better believe Miki Miura will put you down if you fuck with her.
The boys have wised up, they mostly treat me like a person instead of a
pair of tits on legs, there&rsquo;s just a couple of girls who need to be
brought into line now.
</p>

<p>
I scoop Suzu up and head to my room. It&rsquo;s a pain juggling her rigid body
as I try to get my keys out, even more so when I go to grab them with my
stump. Why can&rsquo;t I get used to not having that hand? Once I&rsquo;m through
the door I dump her on the bed and check her vital signs like Nurse
showed me. All good, so I sit at my desk and pick up this week&rsquo;s Number
while I wait for her to reboot. Ugh, do they <i>have</i> to put gross sumo
wrestlers on the front cover?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Miki.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hey, what for?&rdquo; I move over and perch on the side of the bed. Big
mistake, she limpets on to me as soon as I&rsquo;m in range. I try to
disengage before the power of the sleepy puppy eyes makes me accept my
fate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not unconscious during an episode, I heard you fighting
with Ritsu.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not your fault she&rsquo;s a bitch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with her bitchiness if it wasn&rsquo;t for me. I
don&rsquo;t understand why you care for me, but I&rsquo;m thankful that you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yeah, I&rsquo;m not admitting that Nurse was right when he told me looking out
for someone would help me feel less empty inside. &ldquo;What set you off? You
haven&rsquo;t had one of those attacks since we came back after the summer
break.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The way he was paralysed on the bed with that creepy guy coming for
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I guess it <i>is</i> a freaky video for such a pretty tune, but it&rsquo;s only
make-believe, nothing to get upset over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shivers. &ldquo;It brought back bad memories.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Anything you wanna talk about, or are those sleeping dogs better left
to lie?&rdquo; Oof, I had no idea she could squeeze so hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People are mean, Miki. Ever since I&rsquo;ve been having cataplexy attacks
someone has thought it funny to mess with me. You can&rsquo;t imagine how it
feels to know they&rsquo;re going to do something humiliating to you but not
be able to stop them. It hasn&rsquo;t been so bad here once you took me under
your wing, which is another thing I&rsquo;ve got to be thankful for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve learnt not to fuck with Miki&rsquo;s pals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I swear, if I didn&rsquo;t know better, I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;ve been using me as an
excuse to get into fights&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ouch. I shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate this girl, her sleepy face hides a
shrewd judge of character. &ldquo;Pfff as if I need an excuse to get into a
fight!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah well, anyway I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;m left alone now and you&rsquo;re not
having to get your knuckles patched up by Nurse quite so often.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait, you&rsquo;re trying to tell me remembering being given a sharpie
moustache set you off? That doesn&rsquo;t fit with the other times, they were
triggered by a shock or getting angry enough to spit feathers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you keeping track of my episodes Miki?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh at me! I like to be prepared, to anticipate if I&rsquo;ve gotta
jump in. I had no reason to think you were gonna have a problem today so
I was slow to react.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well you didn&rsquo;t seem slow to me. Thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Where does she get off kissing me? Lucky it&rsquo;s just on the cheek, if
she&rsquo;d taken proper liberties I&rsquo;d have&#x2026;no, don&rsquo;t get sidetracked Miki,
she&rsquo;s trying to bamboozle you. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying your story Suzu and a
half-hearted smooch isn&rsquo;t gonna distract me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying you want me to try harder?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m saying start making sense or tell me to fuck off if you don&rsquo;t
wanna talk about it. Either way, don&rsquo;t insult my intelligence.&rdquo; Shit, is
she going lights out again? &ldquo;Hey, sorry, I shouldn&rsquo;t push you, it&rsquo;s none
of my business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, I need to talk about it, I want someone to know, it&rsquo;s really
difficult though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Damn, she sounds grim. &ldquo;But is that &lsquo;someone&rsquo; me? The school&rsquo;s got
counsellors, the shy girl in our class sees one.&rdquo; So did I, until I made
a deal&#x2026; I don&rsquo;t have a problem with the <i>concept</i> of counselling, it
just wasn&rsquo;t working for me.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a nut-job!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor is she. You said yourself that you need to talk and they&rsquo;re
professionals, they could help a lot more than some bolshie teen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to talk to someone I trust, someone I l&#x2026;like. Right now,
that&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Yay for me. &ldquo;OK but I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re expecting from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just listen a-and don&rsquo;t hate me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Hate</i> her? &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine you doing anything hateful. You&rsquo;re
manipulative, judgemental, a bit spoilt, but you&rsquo;ve got a kind heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wow, thanks for the ringing endorsement, I totally see why you put up
with me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oops. &ldquo;I meant that in a good way, I wouldn&rsquo;t hang out with you if I
didn&rsquo;t think you were OK.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save my analysis of your character till later. Do you know what he
was singing when the scary guy was creeping up on him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not bad at reading English but don&rsquo;t follow well when it&rsquo;s
spoken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on.&rdquo; Her phone is very fancy, makes my second-hand jobbie look
like an antique. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the lyrics, the second verse was being sung
when I flipped out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What. The. Fuck. &ldquo;Who? I will cut his fucking balls off and stuff them
down his throat. No-one does shit like that to my-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Calm down Miki, it&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;m safe here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the fuck do you mean &lsquo;it&rsquo;s OK&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s not OK, it&rsquo;s never OK. How
can you say it&rsquo;s OK?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like I said, I&rsquo;m safe here. It won&rsquo;t happen again, especially with you
to care for me. My mum is an alcoholic and-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your <i>mum</i>?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Looking back I can see she was odd, intrusive, but I didn&rsquo;t question
her behaviour when I was growing up. I could never please her. It didn&rsquo;t
matter how high my grades were or how hard I tried with my
extracurriculars, she always found fault, always pointed out how I could
do better, how I would never be as good as her. Things came to a head
when I started getting my periods. She completely freaked out, called me
a dirty whore who was trying to steal her husband.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fuck, what did your dad do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s relatively normal when he&rsquo;s around and made sure we weren&rsquo;t alone
together, which was easy because of his long hours. When he came home
I&rsquo;d be allowed to talk to him for a few minutes then I&rsquo;d be packed off
to bed so he could eat in peace. Some days he wouldn&rsquo;t be back till
after I was sent up, other times I&rsquo;d be so out of it that I might as
well not have been there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wipes her eyes and glares at me defiantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good man, he
always looks for the best in people so it didn&rsquo;t occur to him she was
trying to drive a wedge between us. He finds my narcolepsy hard to deal
with, he hates that I have to cope with the sleepies and the attacks,
and I think he blames himself for not being able to fix me. It&rsquo;s only
because he wanted to tuck me in one night when he was late home that he
found out what she was doing to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t know if I can listen to much more of this, it&rsquo;s seriously
freaking me out, my heart is thumping like I&rsquo;m in the last twenty metres
of the closest race of my life. Oh get over yourself Miki, you&rsquo;re
supposed to be a bad-ass and you&rsquo;re not even brave enough to hear your
friend out? This is about her, not you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nights when he was back late were the worst. She&rsquo;d get drunk, come to
my room and start laying in to me about my failings. That night she
worked herself into a rage, screaming she&rsquo;d make sure that dad would
never want my rancid cunt. I was so shocked I had an episode and there
was nothing I could do when she came at me with a lemon reamer. I lay
there terrified of what she was going to do, unable to move or even
scream, when dad walked in and told her to go downstairs and wait for
him. He was super calm but <i>so</i> scary, she went as pale as a sheet and
stumbled out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Holy shit Suzu, no wonder the video freaked you out. What happened
then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He held me and stroked my hair. When I could move again I clung on to
him and sobbed. He said how sorry he was that this happened, how he was
a failure for being too distant from us to see it coming. Then he said
divorcing her was out of the question but he would make sure I would be
protected in future. And I was, the next day he brought home a governess
who was more Molly Millions than Mary Poppins.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So he didn&rsquo;t actually solve the problem? Took the coward&rsquo;s way out?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that easy Miki, a divorce would cause huge problems with both
families and I&rsquo;m already an embarrassment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well if he really cared for you-&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said it&rsquo;s not that simple!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wow, the kitten&rsquo;s got claws. &ldquo;OK, OK. How much did it fuck you up?&rdquo;
Good, she can smile about it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The nightmares were dreadful for a few weeks, but when I saw how broken
she&rsquo;d become, drinking all day, not taking care of herself, I realised
that <i>I</i> was the strong one, the survivor. I didn&rsquo;t exactly feel sorry
for her, but I found it hard to hate her. Spending time with dad and
getting to know him helped too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Almost sounds like a happy ending, so how come you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was a happy ending. It was extremely uncomfortable
for us to be in the same house, to be reminded of what she&rsquo;d tried to do
when I saw her every day. Even worse was the hypocrisy, having to
present a united front at family events. I understand why but it was
awful, it hurt to see dad treating her as if nothing had happened. I was
in the last year of middle school while this was going on and when he
suggested going to Yamaku I jumped at the chance. I&rsquo;m hundreds of
kilometres away from her, I&rsquo;m getting proper medical care, a decent
education, I feel like I&rsquo;m able to be a normal teen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Normal? Yeah, now that I think about it, everyone here has their issues
but when it comes down to it we&rsquo;re all just high-schoolers muddling our
way through life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Apart from missing my dad, I&rsquo;m pretty happy. There&rsquo;s much less pressure
on me and most of the teachers know I&rsquo;m not being lazy when I fall
asleep in class. And I found you, I&rsquo;ve never had someone watch over me
like you do.&rdquo;

The squeezing again! &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get the wrong idea, I&rsquo;m just looking out for
the underdog. How are you feeling? Ready to go back to the common room?&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t be bothered with those cows right now. Do you want to head
into town for pizza, my treat?&rdquo;

&ldquo;You just said the magic words! Your card better not be maxed out, I&rsquo;m
ordering a large with extra toppings. I&rsquo;ll need the energy if I have to
lug you all the way back&#x2026;&rdquo; Though to be honest carrying her isn&rsquo;t a
burden, not even those last few winding turns up to the main gate; she&rsquo;s
light enough to pierce my gloom.
