* Tasks
Adding text after a headline is just great

** TODO Get the new album by Mary Lattimore, produced by Neil Halstead
[[https://marylattimoreharpist.bandcamp.com/album/silver-ladders][Available on bandcamp]] SCHEDULED: <2020-10-09 Fri>
** TODO Get the 50th anniversary remix of The Man Who Sold The World
[[https://www.davidbowie.com/blog/2020/9/4/metrobolist-aka-the-man-who-sold-the-world-50th-anniversary-edition?fbclid=IwAR0aFbavuaeiAFHpEEDwQePtdctmKmzFJBQS3q2SFn9aOJ-TdLechtsTM3s][Announcement]] SCHEDULED: <2020-11-06 Fri>
** TODO Check out syncthing
[[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] is an open equivalent to dropbox/iCloud/onedrive
- Open protocol/source/development is a bonus
- Can sync multiple directories and files, so there is no need to put everything under a single subdirectory
- Dropbox has the advantage that it also has version control in their servers which has saved me in the past
- Perhaps try it out on my emacs setup initially.
** DONE An interesting literate config file
[[https://github.com/alhassy/emacs.d][Here]] - looking through it and recommending it!
** DONE Spend some more time with fswatch
- [[https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch][fswatch]] is a utility which can watch files and react to them changing state.
- I want to watch the files which are being worked on and react when they are updated -- I don't need to know which file has changed, just that one or more of them has. The following invocation of fswatch allows this.
#+begin_src bash
fswatch --event Updated -o ~/Org/Roam
#+end_src
- Pipe the output from this command into a bash script to do whatever you want to do when the change has occurred. For example:
#+begin_src bash
while read NUM ;
do
  pdflatex test
done
#+end_src
- In my use-case, I want to export the master file when any of the constituents have changed. The following use of emacsclient performs the export on the desired file.
#+begin_src bash
emacsclient -e "(progn (find-file \"~/Test/test.org\") (org-export-and-save) (previous-buffer))"
#+end_src
- A complete command line which looks for updated files, exports the master, and runs LaTeX on it is given below.
#+begin_src
fswatch --event Updated -o ~/Org/Roam/ | while read NUM ; do emacsclient -e "(progn (find-file \"~/Test/test.org\") (org-export-and-save) (previous-buffer))" ; pdflatex -synctex=1 test ; done
#+end_src
** DONE start new org file for tutorial
This was rather easy

** DONE Install emacs into wsl
There is an awesome [[https://medium.com/@elecming/the-ultimate-emacs-hacking-tutorial-in-windows-10-wsl-2-cfd3ea3893e3][guide]]
** PROG Some awesome CSS files for the HTML exporter:
- The [[https://gongzhitaao.org/orgcss/][gongzhitaao theme]] is simple and clean and can be activated by adding a reference to the CSS file in the header -- see [[file:work.org][work.org]] for an example.
- [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][fniessen]] provides a couple of setup themes which are great. See above for usage.

** PROG Sharing emacs configurations
- [[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] doesn't work on two local directories - well, it could but you'd have to run two instances of the daemon on different ports. More trouble than it's worth.
- Dear old rsync and Dropbox seems to be the way. Dropbox to share between machines and installations, rsync to synchronise the directories using a command such as:
#+begin_src bash
rsync -arv --progress --delete ~/.emacs.d/ /mnt/h/Dropbox/Emacs/emacs.d
#+end_src
** NEXT How about a bit of sumo?
Livestream available on [[https://www.twitch.tv/mbovosumo][Twitch]]. The [[https://tachiai.org/][tachiai]] blog site.

** WAIT How about a bit of gnuplot?

* Bombay Bicycle Club is awesome.
Their website can be found [[https://bombaybicycle.club/][here]]. They also have a [[https://www.facebook.com/bombaybicycleclub/][Facebook page]] and a [[https://bombaybicycle.bandcamp.com/releases][Bandcamp page]]. Their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Bicycle_Club][Wikipedia page]] has a lot of information about the band, this little section is just to demonstrate org!
